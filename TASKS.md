# ARM7TDMI-S implementation and release task ledger

## How to read this file

Sections 0–30 are the original build roadmap plus a later TRM addendum. They describe
work that a complete implementation requires; they are **not evidence that the work has
been completed**. In particular, an RTL block existing, a decoder recognizing an
instruction class, or a test printing `PASS` is not enough to mark a requirement done.

Section 31 is the canonical readiness audit and release gate. It was added after a
source-level and test-level audit of baseline commit
`23bb86a73f60f1b64d1929632befc532e736a148` on 2026-07-28. If a status statement
elsewhere in the repository conflicts with §31, §31 wins until the conflicting statement
is corrected and linked to passing evidence.

Use these status words consistently:

- **VERIFIED** — the requirement has a fail-hard, self-checking test against an
  identified authoritative requirement, and the release regression records it passing.
- **IMPLEMENTED, UNVERIFIED** — a plausible RTL path exists, but the required evidence
  does not.
- **PARTIAL** — only a subset or simplified/scaffold behavior exists.
- **INCORRECT** — the present RTL or test expectation conflicts with the selected
  specification.
- **MISSING** — no implementation or evidence was found.
- **OUT OF SCOPE** — excluded by an explicit release profile and replaced by a defined
  tie-off or adapter contract.

Nothing in this repository is currently signed off as a drop-in MiSTer CPU IP release.
The unchecked gates in §31 are the work needed to reach that claim.

# 0. Define the target

Your final target should be a synthesizable SystemVerilog implementation with these major blocks:

```text
arm7tdmis_top
├── clock/reset/clock-enable control
├── programmer-visible CPU core
│   ├── register bank: 31 x 32-bit GPRs + 6 status registers
│   ├── CPSR/SPSR logic
│   ├── ARM decoder
│   ├── Thumb decoder/decompressor
│   ├── barrel shifter
│   ├── ALU
│   ├── multiplier / multiply-accumulate unit
│   ├── address generator
│   ├── load/store unit
│   ├── exception/interrupt controller
│   └── 3-stage pipeline control
├── ARM7TDMI-S memory interface
├── coprocessor interface
├── internal CP14 debug communications channel
├── external CP15/system-control attachment or no-CP15 tie-off, as selected by profile
├── EmbeddedICE-RT debug macrocell
├── JTAG/TAP scan interface
├── ETM7-facing trace interface
└── synthesis/scan/timing wrapper
```

The TRM’s Figure 1-3 is the best architectural starting point: it shows the address register/incrementer, register bank, 32x8 multiplier, barrel shifter, 32-bit ALU, instruction pipeline, read/write data registers, Thumb decoder, instruction decoder/control logic, memory signals, debug signals, and coprocessor handshake signals. 

---

# 1. Build the project skeleton

Implement these first:

1. Create the repo structure:

```text
rtl/
  core/
  decode/
  datapath/
  memory/
  coproc/
  debug/
  jtag/
  etm/
  top/
tb/
  unit/
  integration/
  formal/
  programs/
docs/
scripts/
```

2. Define common SystemVerilog packages:

```text
arm7tdmis_types_pkg.sv
arm7tdmis_instr_pkg.sv
arm7tdmis_psr_pkg.sv
arm7tdmis_bus_pkg.sv
arm7tdmis_debug_pkg.sv
```

3. Define enums for:

```text
ARM/Thumb state
processor modes
exception types
memory transfer size
memory transfer type
ALU operation
shifter operation
pipeline stage state
coprocessor handshake state
debug state
```

4. Define your top-level pin list directly from the TRM:

```text
CLK
CLKEN
nRESET
CFGBIGEND
nIRQ
nFIQ
ABORT

ADDR[31:0]
WRITE
SIZE[1:0]
PROT[1:0]
LOCK
TRANS[1:0]
WDATA[31:0]
RDATA[31:0]

CPnMREQ
CPSEQ
CPnTRANS
CPnOPC
CPTBIT
CPnI
CPA
CPB

DBGEN
DBGRQ
DBGBREAK
DBGACK
DBGnEXEC
DBGINSTRVALID
DBGEXT[1:0]
DBGRNG[1:0]
DBGCOMMTX
DBGCOMMRX

DBGTCKEN
DBGTMS
DBGTDI
DBGTDO
DBGnTRST
DBGnTDOEN
DMORE
```

The memory bus is grouped into clock/control, address-class, memory request, and data-timed signals; the TRM lists `CLK`, `CLKEN`, `nRESET`, `ADDR`, `WRITE`, `SIZE`, `PROT`, `LOCK`, `TRANS`, `WDATA`, `RDATA`, and `ABORT` as the main memory-interface signals. 

---

# 2. Build the verification framework before the CPU

Before writing the full core, build the test environment.

Tasks:

1. Create a simple behavioral memory model.

2. Support byte, halfword, and word accesses.

3. Support little-endian and big-endian modes using `CFGBIGEND`.

4. Support `ABORT` injection.

5. Support wait states using `CLKEN`.

6. Create a simple program loader for assembled ARM/Thumb binaries.

7. Create a cycle logger that records:

```text
cycle
PC
CPSR
mode
ARM/Thumb state
fetched instruction
decoded instruction
executed instruction
ADDR
WRITE
SIZE
PROT
LOCK
TRANS
WDATA
RDATA
exception state
debug state
```

8. Create assertion checks for:

```text
no register write when instruction condition fails
correct PC value visible to instructions
correct CPSR flag updates
correct exception vectoring
correct memory transaction type
correct byte-lane extraction
correct pipeline flush on branch/exception
```

9. Build directed tests first, then random instruction tests later.

10. Build a reference model path. This can be a small non-synthesizable interpreter in Python/C++/SystemVerilog testbench code, or comparison against another trusted ARMv4T emulator.

---

# 3. Implement the programmer-visible state

Implement the architectural state before the pipeline.

Tasks:

1. Implement the full register bank.

2. Implement User/System registers:

```text
r0-r15
CPSR
```

3. Implement banked FIQ registers:

```text
r8_fiq-r14_fiq
SPSR_fiq
```

4. Implement banked IRQ registers:

```text
r13_irq
r14_irq
SPSR_irq
```

5. Implement banked Supervisor registers:

```text
r13_svc
r14_svc
SPSR_svc
```

6. Implement banked Abort registers:

```text
r13_abt
r14_abt
SPSR_abt
```

7. Implement banked Undefined registers:

```text
r13_und
r14_und
SPSR_und
```

8. Implement CPSR fields:

```text
N Z C V
I
F
T
M[4:0]
reserved bits
```

9. Implement mode decode:

```text
User       10000
FIQ        10001
IRQ        10010
Supervisor 10011
Abort      10111
Undefined  11011
System     11111
```

10. Implement register-read mapping for every mode.

11. Implement register-write mapping for every mode.

12. Implement SPSR access rules.

13. Implement PC read behavior for ARM state.

14. Implement PC read behavior for Thumb state.

15. Implement PC write behavior and pipeline flush request.

The ARM7TDMI-S has 37 total registers: 31 general-purpose 32-bit registers and 6 status registers. Which registers are visible depends on current processor mode and ARM/Thumb state. 

---

# 4. Implement reset and basic mode control

Tasks:

1. Implement asynchronous or externally synchronized `nRESET` behavior according to your top-level choice.

2. On reset:

```text
mode = Supervisor
I = 1
F = 1
T = 0
PC = 0x00000000
ARM state
```

3. Treat other registers as architecturally indeterminate after reset.

4. Flush pipeline on reset.

5. Start fetching from vector address `0x00000000`.

The TRM states that when `nRESET` is released, the core enters Supervisor mode, sets the I and F bits, clears T, forces the PC to fetch from address `0x00`, and resumes in ARM state. 

---

# 5. Implement the core datapath primitives

Build these modules independently and unit-test each one.

## 5.1 Barrel shifter

Implement:

```text
LSL immediate
LSL register
LSR immediate
LSR register
ASR immediate
ASR register
ROR immediate
ROR register
RRX
```

Tasks:

1. Produce shifted result.

2. Produce shifter carry-out.

3. Handle special shift amounts.

4. Handle immediate rotate encoding for ARM data-processing immediates.

5. Support register-controlled shifts using the bottom 8 bits of the shift register.

SUB
RSB
ADD
ADC

```

Tasks:

1. Generate result.

2. Generate N/Z flags.

3. Generate carry/borrow flag.

4. Generate signed overflow flag.

2. Implement signed and unsigned long results.

3. Implement accumulate variants.

4. Implement flag updates for `S` variants.

5. Add cycle-control hooks for ARM7TDMI-S multiply timing.

The TRM’s core diagram includes a `32 x 8` multiplier, and Chapter 7 states that multiply instructions use special hardware with early termination.  

---

# 6. Implement condition-code evaluation

Every ARM instruction is conditional.

Tasks:

1. Decode `cond[31:28]`.

2. Implement:

```text
EQ NE CS CC MI PL VS VC HI LS GE LT GT LE AL
```

3. Generate `condition_pass`.

4. Suppress register writes when the condition fails.

5. Suppress memory writes when the condition fails.

6. Suppress CPSR writes when the condition fails.

7. Generate `DBGnEXEC` correctly for instructions that reach execute but fail the condition.

8. Confirm that unexecuted instructions still consume correct cycles.

The TRM notes that ARM-state instructions can execute conditionally, while in Thumb state only branch instructions are conditional. 

---

# 7. Implement a simple non-pipelined ARM execution model

This is a temporary milestone, not the final core.

Tasks:

1. Fetch one 32-bit instruction.

2. Decode it.

3. Execute it.

4. Update architectural state.

5. Ignore exact cycle timing for now.

6. Run small assembly programs.

7. Verify ALU, flags, branches, loads, stores, and exceptions at an architectural level.

This gives you a known-good core before adding pipeline timing.

---

# 8. Implement ARM instruction decode

Build a clean decoder that produces a normalized internal micro-operation.

## ARM decode groups

Implement decode for:

1. Branch:

```text
B
BL
BX
```

2. Data processing:

```text
AND EOR SUB RSB ADD ADC SBC RSC
TST TEQ CMP CMN
ORR MOV BIC MVN
```

3. PSR transfer:

MSR SPSR
```

4. Multiply:

```text
MUL
MLA
UMULL
UMLAL
SMULL
SMLAL
```

5. Single data transfer:

SWPB
```

9. Coprocessor instructions:

```text
CDP
MCR
MRC
LDC
STC
```

10. Software interrupt:

SWI
```

11. Undefined instructions.

The TRM summarizes the ARM instruction set groups as move/PSR transfer, arithmetic, multiply, compare/test, logical, branch, load/store, block transfer, swap, coprocessor, and software interrupt instructions. 

---

# 9. Implement ARM data-processing execution

Tasks:

1. Decode operand 2:

```text
immediate rotated right
register
register shifted by immediate
register shifted by register
RRX
```

2. Read `Rn`.

3. Read `Rm`.

4. Read `Rs` when needed.

5. Run barrel shifter.

6. Run ALU.

7. Write `Rd` when applicable.

8. Update flags when `S = 1`.

9. Handle `Rd = PC`.

10. Handle `S = 1` and `Rd = PC` restoring CPSR from SPSR where architecturally required.

11. Handle `PC` as operand.

12. Verify every opcode with directed tests.

Chapter 7 says data operations normally execute in one datapath cycle, except register-specified shifts, and that writing the PC invalidates the current pipeline and forces a pipeline refill. 

---

# 10. Implement ARM branch instructions

Tasks:

1. Implement `B`.

2. Implement `BL`.

3. Implement `BX`.

4. Implement sign-extension of branch offset.

5. Implement link register update.

6. Implement ARM-to-Thumb transition through `BX`.

7. Implement Thumb-to-ARM transition through `BX`.

8. Flush/refill pipeline after branch.

9. Verify PC and LR values.

10. Verify branch timing later against Chapter 7.

The TRM states that ARM/Thumb branches and ARM `BL` take three cycles, and that `BX` takes three cycles while extracting both the destination address and new core state from the register source.  

---

# 11. Implement ARM load/store address generation

Tasks:

1. Implement Addressing Mode 2:

```text
immediate offset
register offset
scaled register offset
pre-indexed
post-indexed
up/down
writeback
byte/word transfer
T/user-mode transfer variants
```

2. Implement Addressing Mode 3:

```text
halfword
signed halfword
signed byte

```

3. Implement effective address generation.

4. Implement base register writeback.

5. Implement PC-relative loads.

6. Implement byte extraction.

7. Implement halfword extraction.

8. Implement sign extension for `LDRSB` and `LDRSH`.

9. Implement unaligned behavior according to ARMv4T rules.

10. Implement data abort suppression rules.

11. Implement destination `PC` load pipeline refill.

The memory system must support byte, halfword, and word quantities; words are aligned to 4-byte boundaries, halfwords to 2-byte boundaries, and byte accesses can occur on any byte boundary. 

---

# 12. Implement ARM block data transfer

Tasks:

1. Implement `LDM`.

2. Implement `STM`.

3. Support all addressing modes:

```text
IA
IB
DA
DB
FD
ED
FA
EA aliases at assembly level, if you build assembler-facing tests
```

4. Implement register-list iteration order.

5. Implement base writeback.

6. Implement empty register-list behavior according to architecture rules.

7. Implement `^` user-register transfer behavior.

8. Implement `LDM ... PC` behavior.

9. Implement `LDM ... PC^` CPSR restore behavior.

10. Implement abort behavior.

11. Implement `DMORE` for Rev 4 multiple transfers.

12. Verify all register-list combinations.

13. Verify cycle timing for 1-register and n-register transfers.

Chapter 7 describes `LDM` as calculating the first address, fetching words sequentially, latching the modified base for abort recovery, preventing register writes after abort, and invalidating the pipeline if PC is loaded. 

---

# 13. Implement ARM swap

Tasks:

1. Implement `SWP`.

2. Implement `SWPB`.

3. Generate locked bus access using `LOCK`.

4. Perform read cycle.

5. Perform write cycle.

6. Update destination register only after successful read/write sequence.

7. Handle aborts.

8. Verify atomic read/write bus behavior.

The TRM states that `LOCK` is asserted for `SWP`/`SWPB`, and Chapter 7 shows `LOCK` high for both load and store data cycles of the swap operation.  

---

# 14. Implement exceptions and interrupts

Implement exceptions only after ARM instruction execution mostly works.

Tasks:

1. Implement exception types:

```text
Reset
Undefined instruction
Software interrupt
Prefetch abort
Data abort
IRQ
FIQ
```

2. Implement exception vectors:

```text
0x00000000 Reset
0x00000004 Undefined
0x00000008 SWI
0x0000000C Prefetch Abort
0x00000010 Data Abort
0x00000014 Reserved
0x00000018 IRQ
0x0000001C FIQ
```

3. Implement exception priority:

```text
Reset
Data Abort
FIQ
IRQ
Prefetch Abort
Undefined instruction
SWI
```

4. On exception entry:

```text
save return address into mode-specific LR
copy CPSR to mode-specific SPSR
change mode bits
set interrupt disable bits as required
clear T bit
force ARM state
load PC with vector address
flush/refill pipeline
```

5. Implement exception return behavior.

6. Implement `MOVS PC, LR` and `SUBS PC, LR, #imm` return paths.

7. Implement `FIQ` banked registers.

8. Implement `IRQ` masking through CPSR.I.

9. Implement `FIQ` masking through CPSR.F.

10. Implement `nIRQ` and `nFIQ` sampling.

11. Implement data abort behavior for:

```text
single load/store
swap
LDM/STM
```

12. Implement prefetch abort tracking through the pipeline.

13. Verify exception entry from ARM state.

14. Verify exception entry from Thumb state.

15. Verify exception return to ARM state.

16. Verify exception return to Thumb state.

The TRM gives the exception entry/exit behavior, including saving return addresses in the appropriate LR, copying CPSR to SPSR, changing mode, forcing vector fetch, and handling exceptions in ARM state even when the exception occurred in Thumb state. 

---

# 15. Implement Thumb instruction support

Thumb is not just a smaller decoder; it changes fetch width, PC behavior, available registers, and branch behavior.

Tasks:

1. Implement Thumb fetch alignment.

2. Implement Thumb PC behavior.

3. Implement Thumb decoder.

4. Decode Thumb instructions into the same internal micro-op format used by ARM where possible.

5. Implement Thumb low-register ALU operations:

```text
MOV
ADD
SUB
ADC
SBC
NEG
CMP
CMN
MUL
AND
EOR
ORR
BIC
MVN
TST
```

6. Implement Thumb shifts:

```text
LSL
LSR
ASR
ROR
```

7. Implement high-register operations:

```text
MOV high/low
ADD high/low
CMP high/low
BX
```

8. Implement immediate operations:

```text
MOV immediate
CMP immediate
ADD immediate
SUB immediate
```

9. Implement PC-relative load.

10. Implement SP-relative load/store.

11. Implement register-offset load/store:

```text
LDR
STR
LDRB
STRB
LDRH
STRH
LDRSB
LDRSH
```

12. Implement immediate-offset load/store.

13. Implement address-generation pseudo-ops:

```text
ADD Rd, PC, #imm
ADD Rd, SP, #imm
ADD/SUB SP, #imm
```

14. Implement multiple transfer:

```text
LDMIA
STMIA
PUSH
POP
PUSH {..., LR}
POP {..., PC}
```

15. Implement conditional branches.

16. Implement unconditional branch.

17. Implement Thumb long branch with link.

18. Implement Thumb `SWI`.

19. Implement Thumb-to-ARM exception entry.

20. Verify every Thumb encoding group.

The TRM states that ARM7TDMI-S has two states: ARM state executes 32-bit word-aligned ARM instructions, and Thumb state executes 16-bit halfword-aligned Thumb instructions. It also states that exceptions are handled in ARM state and that Thumb exceptions automatically switch to ARM state. 

---

# 16. Replace the simple execution model with the 3-stage pipeline

Now make the implementation structurally match ARM7TDMI-S.

Tasks:

1. Implement pipeline stages:

```text
Fetch
Decode
Execute
```

2. Implement instruction fetch stage.

3. Implement decode stage.

4. Implement execute stage.

5. Implement pipeline valid bits.

6. Implement pipeline flush on:

```text
branch
PC write
exception
debug entry
reset
state switch
```

7. Implement pipeline refill.

8. Implement ARM PC offset behavior:

```text
execute-stage instruction sees PC ahead due to pipeline
```

9. Implement Thumb PC offset behavior.

10. Implement interlocks for multi-cycle instructions.

11. Implement multi-cycle sequencing for:

```text
register-controlled shifts
multiply
load/store
LDM/STM
SWP
coprocessor transfers
exceptions
debug state
```

12. Implement instruction prefetch during execute when allowed.

13. Implement internal cycles when no useful memory access is possible.

14. Verify that branches, exceptions, and loads to PC refill the pipeline correctly.

The ARM7TDMI-S uses a three-stage Fetch/Decode/Execute pipeline, and the PC points to the instruction being fetched rather than the instruction being executed. 

---

# 17. Implement the ARM7TDMI-S memory interface

This is where your core becomes ARM7TDMI-S-like rather than just ARMv4T-compatible.

Tasks:

1. Implement the pipelined bus interface.

2. Generate address-class signals one bus cycle ahead of data transfer:

```text
ADDR[31:0]
WRITE
SIZE[1:0]
PROT[1:0]
LOCK
```

3. Generate transaction type:

```text
TRANS[1:0]
00 I-cycle
01 C-cycle
10 N-cycle
11 S-cycle
```

4. Implement N-cycle generation.

5. Implement S-cycle generation.

6. Implement I-cycle generation.

7. Implement C-cycle generation.

8. Implement merged I-S cycle behavior.

9. Implement sequential bursts:

```text
word read burst
word write burst
halfword read burst
```

10. Implement `CLKEN` bus-cycle extension.

11. Hold/update internal bus state only when `CLKEN` allows the bus cycle to complete.

12. Implement `RDATA` sampling.

13. Implement `WDATA` drive timing.

14. Implement `ABORT` sampling.

15. Implement `SIZE` encoding:

```text
00 byte
01 halfword
10 word
11 reserved
```

16. Implement `PROT` encoding:

```text
user/privileged
opcode/data
```

17. Implement `LOCK`.

18. Implement `DMORE` for LDM/STM sequential data access indication.

19. Implement little-endian byte/halfword extraction.

20. Implement big-endian byte/halfword extraction.

21. Implement byte/halfword write-data replication.

The TRM states that the bus interface is pipelined, with address-class and memory-request signals broadcast one bus cycle ahead of the bus cycle they refer to. It also defines the four `TRANS[1:0]` cycle types: internal, coprocessor register transfer, nonsequential, and sequential. 

---

# 18. Make the core cycle-accurate

Once architectural execution works, match the timing tables.

Tasks:

1. Create a cycle-count test suite from Chapter 7.

2. Verify normal data-processing timing.

3. Verify register-controlled shift timing.

4. Verify data-processing with destination PC timing.

5. Verify branch timing.

6. Verify ARM `BL` timing.

7. Verify Thumb `BL` timing.

8. Verify `BX` timing.

9. Verify multiply timing.

10. Verify multiply-accumulate timing.

11. Verify long multiply timing.

12. Verify load timing.

13. Verify store timing.

14. Verify `LDM` timing.

15. Verify `STM` timing.

16. Verify `SWP` timing.

17. Verify `SWI` and exception-entry timing.

18. Verify coprocessor timing.

19. Verify undefined instruction timing.

20. Verify unexecuted instruction timing.

21. Verify bus `TRANS`, `PROT`, `SIZE`, `WRITE`, and `LOCK` values cycle by cycle.

The TRM’s Chapter 7 explicitly gives instruction cycle timings for branches, data operations, multiply, load/store, block transfer, swap, SWI/exception entry, coprocessor operations, undefined instructions, and unexecuted instructions. 

---

# 19. Implement coprocessor instruction handling

Tasks:

1. Decode ARM coprocessor instructions:

```text
CDP
MRC
MCR
LDC
STC
```

2. Generate coprocessor pipeline-following signals:

```text
CPnMREQ
CPSEQ
CPnTRANS
CPnOPC
CPTBIT
```

3. Generate `CPnI`.

4. Sample `CPA`.

5. Sample `CPB`.

6. Implement coprocessor absent behavior.

7. Implement coprocessor busy-wait behavior.

8. Implement coprocessor ready behavior.

9. Implement abandonment of busy-waiting coprocessor instruction on interrupt/debug request.

10. Implement C-cycle bus usage.

11. Implement data transfer from ARM register to coprocessor for `MCR`.

12. Implement data transfer from coprocessor to ARM register for `MRC`.

13. Implement memory-to-coprocessor transfer for `LDC`.

14. Implement coprocessor-to-memory transfer for `STC`.

15. Implement undefined instruction trap when no coprocessor accepts the instruction.

16. Implement privileged coprocessor behavior using `CPnTRANS`.

17. Tie off external coprocessor inputs correctly when no external coprocessor is present.

The TRM says each coprocessor tracks the ARM pipeline, uses `CPnI`, `CPA`, and `CPB` for handshaking, and that unaccepted coprocessor instructions take the undefined instruction trap. 

---

# 20. Implement internal coprocessor 14: Debug Communications Channel

Tasks:

1. Implement CP14 decode for DCC instructions.

2. Implement DCC control register.

3. Implement DCC data write register.

4. Implement DCC data read register.

5. Implement processor-to-debugger transfer.

6. Implement debugger-to-processor transfer.

7. Implement `DBGCOMMTX`.

8. Implement `DBGCOMMRX`.

9. Implement JTAG access to DCC through scan chain 2.

10. Implement DCC status bits.

11. Verify polling sequences from processor side.

12. Verify polling sequences from debugger side.

The TRM states that the EmbeddedICE-RT DCC is implemented as coprocessor 14, has a 32-bit control register and 32-bit data register, and is accessed by the processor using `MCR`/`MRC` instructions to CP14. 

---

# 21. Handle CP15/system-control attachment correctly

Tasks:

1. Treat CP15 as an external coprocessor allocation, not an internal register bank in
   the bare ARM7TDMI-S profile.

2. With no system coprocessor attached, use `CPA=CPB=1` behavior and take Undefined
   for executed CP15 instructions.

3. If a SoC profile needs an MMU/MPU/system coprocessor, implement it outside the CPU
   and make it claim p15 through the normal coprocessor protocol.

4. Do not fabricate an ARM7TDMI-S Main ID register. ARM DAI 0099C explicitly states
   that ARM7TDMI and ARM7TDMI-S do not have CP15.

5. Verify absent-p15 Undefined behavior, condition-failed suppression, User/privileged
   `CPnTRANS`, and an attached external p15 independently.

The encoding space reserves coprocessor 15 for a system control coprocessor, but that
does not mean the bare ARM7TDMI-S macrocell contains one. External user coprocessors
must still use CP4–CP7.

---

# 29. Final “complete chip” checklist

A complete implementation should pass this checklist:

```text

[ ] Thumb state implemented
[ ] ARM/Thumb interworking implemented
[ ] All ARM instruction groups implemented
[ ] All Thumb instruction groups implemented
[ ] All processor modes implemented

[ ] TAP IDCODE implemented
[ ] ETM-facing interface implemented
[ ] ATPG/scan wrapper implemented if required
[ ] Full architectural tests pass

```

The hardest parts will be **PC/pipeline semantics**, **LDM/STM abort behavior**, **Thumb interworking**, **cycle-accurate memory bus timing**, and **EmbeddedICE-RT/JTAG debug**. A good learning path is to treat the first working CPU as a stepping stone, then iteratively replace simplified behavior with the exact ARM7TDMI-S behavior from the TRM.

---

# 30. TRM gap-fill addenda (post-roadmap audit)

These items tighten or extend the §1–§29 roadmap to match TRM (`ARM_DDI_0234B_ARM7TDMI-S_r4p3_TRM.pdf`, 242 pages) at the level of detail any conformant implementation must hit. Numbering: **§30.N amends §N**. Page numbers refer to the PDF page (the document's printed page numbers differ).

## 30.0 ARMv4T scope guard — features NOT in r4p3

Do not implement; remove if mistakenly introduced:

1. `BKPT` instruction — ARMv5+ only. Software breakpoints on r4p3 are pattern-matched via EmbeddedICE-RT, not via a `BKPT` opcode (TRM §1.2 / §B.1).
2. `BLX` (immediate or register) — ARMv5+. ARM↔Thumb exchange on r4p3 is `BX` only.
3. `CLZ` — ARMv5+.
4. Q (saturation) flag in CPSR — ARMv5E+.
5. ARM7TDMI hard-macrocell pin names absent from r4p3: `MAS[1:0]` (replaced by `SIZE[1:0]`), `ABE/DBE/TBE`, `ALE/APE`, `BL`, bidirectional `D`, `nM`, `BUSDIS/BUSEN/NnENIN/nNENOUT/nENOUTI` (TRM §B.4.6 Table B-2).
6. Plausible-sounding pins that do not exist: `DBGRESTART`, `DBGINSTR`. `RESTART` is a JTAG TAP *instruction* (`4'b0100`); debug-state instruction injection is via scan chain 1 with bit 33 selecting debug-speed vs system-speed (§30.23.6). `DBGINSTRVALID` is real and distinct.

## 30.3 Programmer-visible state (amends §3)

1. **CPSR/SPSR explicit bit map** (TRM §2.8 Fig. 2-6, p. 48):
   - `[31]=N`, `[30]=Z`, `[29]=C`, `[28]=V` — flags.
   - `[27:8]` reserved — preserve under read-modify-write; never assume a value (TRM §2.8.3, p. 50).
   - `[7]=I` (IRQ disable), `[6]=F` (FIQ disable), `[5]=T` (state), `[4:0]=M[4:0]` (mode).
   - SPSRs share the layout. **No Q flag** (ARMv4T).
2. FIQ banks **7** registers (`r8_fiq…r14_fiq` + `SPSR_fiq`); other exception modes bank only `r13_xxx, r14_xxx, SPSR_xxx` (TRM §2.7.1, p. 56).
3. System mode (`M[4:0]=11111`): privileged, shares User register set, no SPSR (TRM §2.6 / Table 2-2).

## 30.4 Reset (amends §4)

1. `nRESET` must be held LOW for ≥ 2 `CLK` cycles. While LOW, the bus is forced into I-cycles; any in-flight instruction abandons on the next non-wait cycle. On rising `nRESET`, fetching restarts at `0x00000000` (TRM Appendix A `nRESET`, p. 222).
2. `CFGBIGEND` is *static*. Tie or hold stable; must not change during debug. To reconfigure endianness, hold `nRESET` LOW (TRM §5.3.4 Note, p. 121).

## 30.5 Datapath primitives (amends §5)

1. **Multiplier early-termination `m` parameter** drives every multiply's cycle count:
   - `m=1` if `Rs[31:8]` are all 0 or all 1.
   - `m=2` if `Rs[31:16]` are all 0 or all 1.
   - `m=3` if `Rs[31:24]` are all 0 or all 1.
   - `m=4` otherwise.
   - `MUL`: `m·I + S`. `MLA`: `(m+1)·I + S`. `MULL/SMULL`: `(m+1)·I + S`. `MLAL/SMLAL`: `(m+2)·I + S` (TRM §7.7 Tables 7-7..7-10, pp. 194–195).
   - `MULL/MLAL` are ARM-state-only; `MUL` is the only Thumb multiply.

## 30.8 PSR transfer (amends §8 / §9)

1. `MSR` field-mask bits (per Table 1-10): `_c`=bit 16 (control), `_x`=bit 17 (extension, RAZ/SBZP), `_s`=bit 18 (status, RAZ/SBZP), `_f`=bit 19 (flags).
2. User mode may write only `_f` of `CPSR`; privileged modes write any field.
3. **`MSR` and the T bit**: TRM §2.8.2 (p. 49) says programs *must not* alter the T bit via `MSR` — behavior is UNPREDICTABLE. Pick a hardware policy (drop the T-bit write, or honor it and let the architectural UNPREDICTABLE bite); document the choice and exercise with a cycle test.

## 30.10 Branch (amends §10)

1. `B`/`BL` cycle order (TRM §7.3 Table 7-3):
   - Cycle 1: prefetch from current PC continues + destination computed (the prefetch already issued — too late to cancel).
   - Cycle 2: N-cycle fetch from branch destination; if `BL`, save `(PC+i)` to `r14`.
   - Cycle 3: S-cycle fetch from `dest+i`; if `BL`, post-decrement `r14` by 4 so `MOV PC, R14` returns to instruction *after* the BL.
2. Thumb `BL` is two halfwords (TRM §7.4 Table 7-4): first executes as a data-op accumulating `PC + upper_offset` into `r14`; second performs the branch with `r14` fix-up of −2.
3. `BX` cycle order (TRM §7.5 Table 7-5):
   - Cycle 1: `ADDR=PC+2i`, T = current state.
   - Cycle 2: `ADDR=pc'`, T = new state. `CPTBIT` reflects the new state from this cycle on.
   - Cycle 3: `ADDR=pc'+i'`. ARM→Thumb: `i=4, i'=2`; Thumb→ARM: `i=2, i'=4`.

## 30.12 Block data transfer (amends §12)

1. **LDM data abort** (TRM §2.9.6, p. 54; §7.10, p. 199):
   - Complete the instruction but suppress all destination-register writes that follow the abort.
   - If the writeback bit is set, the modified base register *is* written (handler sees post-modified base — restore manually if it must be undone).
   - r15 is always last in the list, so any abort prevents PC overwrite.
2. **STM** writeback completes normally on abort; handler must be aware base is updated.
3. **Empty register list** in LDM/STM is architecturally UNPREDICTABLE; pick a behavior (TRM is silent), document it, and lock it in a cycle test.

## 30.13 SWP (amends §13)

1. `LOCK` HIGH for both data cycles of `SWP/SWPB`. Sequence (TRM §7.12 Table 7-15): `N(prefetch) → N(read, LOCK=1) → I(write, LOCK=1) → S(continue prefetch, LOCK=0)`.
2. SWP is **ARM-state only**.
3. On data abort, `SWP` behaves as if it had not executed; the abort must occur on the read access.

## 30.14 Exceptions (amends §14)

1. **Return-address offsets per exception** (TRM §2.9.1 Table 2-3, p. 51):
   - `BL`/`SWI`/`Undef` from ARM ⇒ save `PC+4` to LR; from Thumb ⇒ save `PC+2`.
   - Prefetch Abort ⇒ save `PC+4`; return via `SUBS PC, R14_abt, #4`.
   - Data Abort ⇒ save `PC+8`; return via `SUBS PC, R14_abt, #8`.
   - IRQ/FIQ ⇒ save `PC+4`; return via `SUBS PC, R14_xxx, #4`.
   - Reset: `r14_svc` is UNPREDICTABLE.
2. **Data Abort + FIQ coincidence**: enter the Data Abort handler first, then immediately vector to FIQ at `0x1C`. A naive priority encoder that fires only the highest-priority exception loses the abort (TRM §2.9.10, p. 60).
3. `nFIQ` and `nIRQ` are **synchronous, level-sensitive**, sampled on rising `CLK`. Hold LOW until handler clears the source. Async sources need an external synchronizer — r4p3 has no `ISYNC` pin (TRM Appendix A; §B.4.4).
4. **Worst-case FIQ latency** = `T_syncmax + T_ldm + T_exc + T_fiq = 2 + 20 + 3 + 2 = 27 cycles` (zero-wait-state, longest LDM including PC). Min FIQ/IRQ latency = 4 cycles. Verify in §27 (TRM §2.10, p. 60).

## 30.17 Memory interface (amends §17)

1. **Von Neumann bus** — instruction and data share `ADDR/RDATA/WDATA`. The pipeline arbitrates one bus cycle for either fetch or data, never both (TRM §1.1.2, p. 19).
2. **Burst rules** (TRM §3.3, pp. 77–79):
   - Bursts are word (+4 per S) or halfword (+2 per S) only. **Byte bursts do not exist.**
   - Within a burst, `WRITE/SIZE/PROT/LOCK` hold constant; only `ADDR` advances.
   - A burst opens with N (or merged I-S); subsequent beats are S.
   - During an I cycle the address of the next sequential access is broadcast for early decode, but the memory controller must not commit during the I cycle (an I may be followed by an N to an unrelated address on PC writes/exceptions).
3. **`SIZE` encoding** (TRM §3.4.3 Table 3-3): `00=byte`, `01=halfword`, `10=word`, `11=reserved` (never generated; assert).
4. **Significant-address-bit rule** (TRM §3.5.4 Table 3-6): word — use `ADDR[31:2]`; halfword — `ADDR[31:1]`; byte — `ADDR[31:0]`.
5. **`ABORT` sampling** (TRM §3.5.3, p. 87): sampled on rising `CLK` *only during S/N memory cycles*; ignored in I/C. On data access, traps immediately. On opcode fetch, marks the prefetched instruction invalid; trap fires only when (and if) it reaches Execute.
6. **`DMORE`** (TRM §1.5.5, p. 40 / Appendix A): HIGH during the current data access ⇒ next data access *will* be sequential (mid-LDM/STM). LOW ⇒ last beat or no immediate further data access. Distinct from `TRANS[1:0]`, which describes the next *transaction's* type.
7. During `nRESET` LOW the bus is forced into I-cycles; existing memory cycles abandon. No spurious access on the way to `0x00000000`.

## 30.18 Cycle accuracy (amends §18)

Anchor each cycle test to an explicit TRM table:

1. **Data-op** (Table 7-6, p. 194): `+S` (1S); shifted-by-register form adds an I.
2. **MSR/MRS** (Table 7-6).
3. **LDR** (Table 7-11, p. 196): `+N+I+S`; if `Rd=PC`, add `+N+S`.
4. **STR** (Table 7-12, p. 196): `+N+N`.
5. **LDM** (Table 7-13, p. 196):
   - 1 reg, dest≠PC: `+N+I+S`.
   - 1 reg, dest=PC: `+N+I+N+2S`.
   - n>1, dest≠PC: `+N+(n−1)S+I+S`.
   - n>1, dest=PC: `+N+(n−1)S+I+N+2S`.
6. **STM** (Table 7-14, p. 197):
   - Chapter 7's summary table (Table 7-2) gives
     `+N+(n−1)S+I+N`.
   - Table 7-14's externally visible address/control rows show `N,N` for one register
     and `N,(n−1)S,N` for multiple registers, while its prose calls the one-register
     case two cycles. Treat this as a specification-reconciliation item: document how
     the internal I operation is represented or overlapped and verify both architectural
     execution time and every external bus row. Do not infer conformance from an
     `n+1` E-state counter alone.
7. **SWP** (Table 7-15): per §30.13.
8. **Exception entry** (Table 7-16, p. 201): `+N+2S` total (cycle 1 N to `PC+2i` in old mode; cycle 2 S to vector `Xn` in new mode/Tbit; cycle 3 S to `Xn+4`).
9. **B/BL** (Table 7-3): `+N+2S`.
10. **BX** (Table 7-5): `+N+2S` with Tbit transitions per §30.10.3.
11. **MUL/MLA/MULL/MLAL** (Tables 7-7..7-10): per §30.5.1.
12. **CDP** (Table 7-17, p. 201): `+S` plus busy-wait I cycles if `CPB` HIGH.
13. **LDC/STC** (Table 7-2; Tables 7-18 / 7-19):
    `+(b)I+N+(n−1)S+N`, with the coprocessor determining the transfer length.
14. **MCR/MRC** (Table 7-2; Tables 7-20 / 7-21):
    `+(b)I+C+N` (`MCR`) and `+(b)I+C+I+S` (`MRC`). Verify the C cycle,
    busy-wait cycles, data phase, and following fetch separately.
15. **Undef / coprocessor-absent trap** (Table 7-22): same path as exception entry.
16. **Unexecuted instruction** (Table 7-23, p. 204): exactly `+S` at `PC+2i`. All side effects suppressed except the bus cycle and `DBGnEXEC` HIGH. Easy smoke test.

## 30.19 Coprocessor interface (amends §19)

1. **Reserved CP IDs** (TRM §4.1.1 Table 4-1): CP15=system control, CP14=DCC + Abort Status Register, CP13:8=ARM-reserved, CP7:4=user-available, CP3:0=ARM-reserved. External coprocessors must use CP4–CP7.
2. **Pipeline-following** (TRM §4.3, p. 93): coprocessors mirror the core. Load into pipeline on rising `CLK` only when `CPnOPC=0 ∧ CPnMREQ=0 ∧ CPTBIT=0` were *all* LOW in the *previous* bus cycle (= ARM-state opcode fetch). Advance pipeline when the same triple is LOW in the *current* cycle. Coprocessor state changes only when `CLKEN` HIGH (except reset).
3. **Privilege via `CPnTRANS`** (TRM §4.8 Table 4-4): `CPnTRANS=0`=User, `=1`=privileged. Coprocessor checks at decode; User-mode access to a privileged-only operation is rejected with `CPA=1, CPB=1` (absent), forcing the undef trap.
4. **Busy-wait abandonment** (TRM §4.4.4, p. 96; §5.3.3, p. 121): on a non-masked IRQ/FIQ or `DBGRQ`, the core takes `CPnI` HIGH. Coprocessor monitors `CPnI` and abandons. Coprocessor actions during busy-wait must be *idempotent* — must not corrupt state and must repeat with identical results.
5. **No-coprocessor tie-off** (TRM §4.6, p. 102; Table 4-3): tie `CPA=1, CPB=1`; leave outputs `CPnMREQ, CPSEQ, CPnTRANS, CPnOPC, CPnI, CPTBIT` unconnected. All coprocessor instructions then take the undef trap. For multiple coprocessors: AND each one's `CPA` together, AND each one's `CPB` together; common `CPnI` fans out.
6. **`CPn`-prefix polarity reminder**: active-LOW (`CPnOPC=0` ⇒ opcode fetch). `CPSEQ`, `CPA`, `CPB` are active-HIGH.
7. LDC/STC may transfer >16 words; this stretches worst-case interrupt latency past 27 cycles. Recommend a 16-word software cap.

## 30.20 CP14 / DCC (amends §20)

1. **CP14 register set**:
   - DCC control register (32-bit): `[31:28]=4'b0111` for an exact r4p3
     implementation. DDI 0234B prints `4'b0001`, but ARM's ARM7TDMI-S Errata List
     (FR002-PRDC-002719 7.0, erratum [9]) says the Rev-4 EmbeddedICE-RT version is
     7 and that r4p3 corrected the JTAG view. `[27:2]` are reserved. `[1]=W`:
     W=0 means the processor-to-debugger transmit buffer is empty and the processor
     may write; W=1 means data is pending and the debugger may scan it out. `[0]=R`:
     R=0 means the debugger-to-processor receive buffer is empty and the debugger may
     write; R=1 means unread data is present and the processor may read it.
   - DCC data-read / data-write register.
   - **Abort Status Register (1 bit `DbgAbt`)** — accessed via `MRC/MCR CP14`. Set when monitor mode causes a Prefetch/Data Abort due to a breakpoint or watchpoint; if both an external `ABORT` and a debug abort coincide, external `ABORT` wins and `DbgAbt` stays 0. Sticky; cleared by software write (TRM §5.23, p. 161).
2. **DCC instructions**:
   - `MRC CP14,0,Rd,C0,C0` — read DCC control.
   - `MRC CP14,0,Rd,C1,C0` — read DCC data-read.
   - `MCR CP14,0,Rn,C1,C0` — write DCC data-write.
3. **Rev 4 single-access optimization** (TRM §5.10.2, pp. 134–135): DCC data and status fit in one scan-chain-2 access; status bit is the LSB of the address field returned. DCC control bit 0 preserved for backward compatibility.
4. **`DBGCOMMRX/TX` polarity** (Appendix A): `DBGCOMMRX=1` ⇒ rx buffer full; `DBGCOMMTX=1` ⇒ tx buffer empty. Both gated by `DBGEN=1`.
5. Coprocessor instructions, **including DCC `MCR/MRC` to CP14, do not exist in Thumb**. Monitor-mode debugger code reaching DCC from Thumb must switch to ARM first.

## 30.22 EmbeddedICE-RT (amends §22)

1. **`DBGEN=0`**: `DBGBREAK/DBGRQ` ignored; `DBGACK` forced LOW; interrupts pass through; macrocell enters low-power. **Caution from TRM**: tying `DBGEN` LOW is not a security mechanism — implement security elsewhere if required (TRM §5.7, p. 124).
2. **Watchpoint mask is XNOR, not AND** (TRM §5.20.2 / §5.26):
   - `match = ((value XNOR input) OR mask) == all-1s`.
   - Mask bit = 1 ⇒ that position always matches; mask bit = 0 ⇒ exact equality required. Common implementation bug is to AND.
3. **Watchpoint coupling** (TRM §5.20.3 / §5.26.1, pp. 169–170):
   - `CHAIN`: WP1's `CHAINOUT` feeds WP0's `CHAIN`. WP1 has no CHAIN input; WP0 has no CHAINOUT.
   - `CHAINOUT` is a latch: write-enable from WP1's address/control comparator, D-input from WP1's data comparator. Cleared on control-value-register write or `DBGnTRST=0`.
   - `RANGE`: WP1's `RANGEOUT` feeds WP0's `RANGE`. Power-of-2 ranges only.
   - `DBGRNG[1:0]` external pins reflect each watchpoint's address/control + data-mask match **independent of the ENABLE bit** (so trace can see range hits without breaking).
   - ENABLE = bit 8 of the 9-bit control-value register; **unmaskable** (no mask-register equivalent for bit 8).
4. **Debug Control Register — 6 bits** (TRM §5.24 Table 5-7, p. 161):
   - `[5]` EmbeddedICE-RT disable (Rev 4).
   - `[4]` Monitor-mode enable (Rev 4 — abort vs halt).
   - `[3]` SBZ/RAZ.
   - `[2]` `INTDIS` (force `IFEN` LOW; mask interrupts even outside debug).
   - `[1]` force-`DBGRQ`.
   - `[0]` force-`DBGACK`.
5. **Debug Status Register — 5 bits, read-only** (TRM §5.25, p. 164):
   - `[4]=TBIT, [3]=TRANS[1], [2]=IFEN, [1]=synced DBGRQ, [0]=synced DBGACK`.
6. **Interrupt-mask logic** (TRM Fig. 5-17, p. 165): `IFEN_to_core = !((bit2 OR DBGACKI) | INTDIS)`. `DBGACK_pin = bit0 OR DBGACKI`. `DBGRQI_to_core = bit1 OR sync(DBGRQ_input)`.
7. **Reprogramming sequence under monitor mode** (TRM §5.9.2, p. 130):
   1. Set debug-control bit 5 (disable).
   2. **Poll** bit 5 read-back until set.
   3. Modify watchpoint registers and/or bit 4.
   4. Clear bit 5.
   - Poll step is mandatory — propagation is async; skipping it causes false matches.
8. **Software breakpoints** (TRM §5.21.2, p. 150):
   - Program a watchpoint with a magic data-value pattern and `0xFFFFFFFF` address mask.
   - For Thumb, **replicate** the 16-bit pattern in both halves of the 32-bit data-value register (a `LDR` may return either halfword on the 32-bit bus).
   - Architectural reservations for breakpoint encodings: ARM `0xE7Fxxxxx`, Thumb `0xDExx/0xBExx`. (No `BKPT` opcode on r4p3 — see §30.0.)
9. **Breakpoint flushed by branch/exception** (TRM §5.3.1, p. 120): if the instruction is flushed (preceding branch / exception / PC write), debug entry is canceled. On exception return + refetch, the breakpoint reflags. Comparator's ENABLE qualification must combine with a pipeline-valid signal.
10. **Watchpoint completion** (TRM §5.3.2 / §5.18.3): fires *after* the access completes (data writeback / base writeback finished). For LDM/STM, many cycles can elapse between match and entry. Watchpointed access that also Data Aborts ⇒ debug state entered in abort mode (vector fetch first). Watchpointed access coincident with another exception ⇒ debug state entered in that exception's mode; debugger disambiguates via CPSR/SPSR/PC.
11. **Monitor-mode restrictions** (TRM §5.9.2): in monitor mode,
    breakpoints/watchpoints **cannot** be data-dependent or RANGE/CHAIN-coupled.
    `DBGEXT[0]` and `DBGEXT[1]` are permitted qualifiers and are explicitly listed
    among the supported monitor conditions. External `DBGBREAK` is not supported.
    Halt and monitor modes cannot mix.
12. **IFEN auto-disable in debug state** (TRM §5.19.2, p. 147): on debug-state entry, IRQ and FIQ are forced disabled internally regardless of `CPSR.I/F`. Pending interrupts at entry are remembered.
13. **Debug-exit return-PC offsets** (TRM §5.18.6, p. 146):
   - Normal break/watch exit: `−(4 + N + 3S)`, with N = debug-speed, S = system-speed.
   - DBGRQ-entry / watchpoint-with-exception: `−(3 + N + 3S)`.
   - System-speed access drops `DBGACK` temporarily; force via control-bit 0 if peripherals must be held inhibited.
14. **Allowable debug-state instructions** (TRM §5.16.1, p. 162): only data-processing, all loads/stores including LDM/STM, and MSR/MRS may be scanned in. STM is the standard register-file dump path. Mode changes between any two modes are allowed in debug state.

## 30.23 JTAG TAP and scan chains (amends §23)

1. **Public JTAG instructions — exactly five** (TRM §5.13 Table 5-3, p. 153):
   `SCAN_N=4'b0010`, `INTEST=4'b1100`, `IDCODE=4'b1110`, `BYPASS=4'b1111`, `RESTART=4'b0100`. Other 4-bit encodings default to `BYPASS`.
2. **Do NOT implement** `EXTEST/SAMPLE/PRELOAD/CLAMP/HIGHZ/CLAMPZ` — there is no boundary-scan chain on r4p3. Selecting them while scan chain 1 or 2 is active yields UNPREDICTABLE behavior (TRM §B.4.3, p. 233).
3. **IR width = 4 bits**, no parity. CAPTURE-IR loads fixed pattern `4'b0001` (LSB-first). SHIFT-IR shifts in LSB-first. UPDATE-IR latches. Reset value = `IDCODE` (TRM §5.14.3, p. 156).
4. **IDCODE** (TRM §5.14.2, p. 155):
   - 32-bit format `[31:28]=Version, [27:12]=PartNumber, [11:1]=ManufacturerID, [0]=1` (LSB always 1 per IEEE 1149.1; do not tie LOW).
   - r4p3 default value `0x7F1F0F0F` (matches `AGENTS.md`).
   - No parallel write. CAPTURE-DR loads the constant; SHIFT-DR clocks LSB-first; UPDATE-DR is a no-op for IDCODE.
5. **Scan chain map**:
   - 0: reserved (returns zeros if selected).
   - 1: debug, **33 bits** = `[31:0]` data + bit 33 (= `[32]`) `DBGBREAK` cell.
   - 2: EmbeddedICE-RT, **38 bits** = `[37]` R/W + `[36:32]` 5-bit reg-addr + `[31:0]` data; commit on UPDATE-DR.
   - 3, 4, 8: reserved.
6. **Scan chain 1 bit-33 dual semantics** (TRM §5.14.5 / §5.16):
   - During INTEST: scans a known value into the `DBGBREAK` input.
   - During debug-state instruction injection: bit 33 = 0 ⇒ run at debug speed; bit 33 = 1 ⇒ run at system speed (sync to `CLKEN`).
   - On debug-state entry capture: bit 33 = 0 ⇒ entered from breakpoint; bit 33 = 1 ⇒ from watchpoint.
   - For a system-speed access: bit 33 HIGH on the penultimate scanned instruction; the final branch has bit 33 LOW. After RESTART, the core executes at full speed via `CLKEN` then re-enters debug state.
7. **TAP reset via `DBGnTRST=0`** (TRM §5.3.5 Fig. 5-4, p. 117; §5.12.1, p. 152):
   - TAP state machine → Test-Logic-Reset.
   - Current instruction → `IDCODE`.
   - Active scan chain → 0.
   - All EmbeddedICE-RT D-types in Fig. 5-4 cleared (TCK synchronizer, TMS/TDI sample-hold).
   - `CHAINOUT` cleared.
   - No `CLK`/`DBGTCKEN` pulse needed.
   - For JTAG use, `DBGnTRST` must pulse LOW then HIGH at power-on; tie LOW permanently if JTAG unused.
8. **`DBGnTDOEN` polarity** (Appendix A): LOW = TDO actively driven; HIGH = HiZ. Gated by `DBGEN`.
9. **3-stage TCK synchronizer** to `CLK` for off-chip Multi-ICE-style debug (TRM Fig. 5-4); off-chip device must wait on `RTCK` before the next TCK edge. TMS/TDI on-chip latches gated by `DBGTCKEN`. All synchronizer flops reset by `DBGnTRST`.
10. **Scan-path-select register**: 4 bits; CAPTURE-DR loads `4'b1000`; UPDATE-DR latches selection. Default chain 0 on TAP reset.
11. **INTEST wire order is chain-specific** (TRM §5.11.1/§5.14.5):
   - Chain 1 physically runs TDI → `DATA[0]` … `DATA[31]` → `DBGBREAK` → TDO.
     `DBGBREAK` is therefore the first captured bit shifted out; a complete host
     load sends `DBGBREAK` followed by `DATA[31:0]` most-significant bit first.
   - Chain 2 physically runs TDI → R/W → `ADDR[4:0]` (4 to 0) →
     `DATA[0:31]` → TDO. Do not serialize either INTEST chain as a generic packed
     LSB-first vector; only IR, IDCODE, and SCAN_N have that stated ordering.

## 30.24 ETM-facing interface (amends §24)

1. **`DBGINSTRVALID`** = HIGH for exactly one cycle per instruction *committed* to Execute. Used by ETM7 to count executed instructions, **not** bus accesses (Appendix A).
2. **Combination rule**: instruction committed = `DBGINSTRVALID && !DBGnEXEC`. `DBGnEXEC` HIGH means an instruction reached Execute but failed its condition codes (no commit).
3. **PROCID tie-off**: r4p3 has no OS context-ID source. When wrapping ETM7, tie `PROCID[31:0]=0` and `PROCIDWR=0` at the ETM input (TRM §6.3 Table 6-1 footnotes, p. 175).
4. **Direct RDATA/WDATA exposure**: connect `RDATA[31:0]` and `WDATA[31:0]` straight to the ETM so coprocessor cycles can be traced (TRM §4.5.1 Note, p. 100).
5. **Reset propagation**: connect system `nTRST`→`DBGnTRST` so `PWRDOWN` and ETM state reset in lockstep with the macrocell (TRM §6.4, p. 176).

## 30.26 AC / timing (amends §26)

1. Bake the TRM Table 8-1 percentage-of-`CLK` budgets into SDC once a toolchain is chosen (TRM §8.2, pp. 216–217). Sample budgets:
   - **Setup**: `CLKEN` 40%, `ABORT` 15%, `RDATA` 10%, `CPA/CPB` 20%, `nFIQ/nIRQ/nRESET` 10%, `CFGBIGEND` 10%, `DBGTCKEN` 40%, `DBGTDI/DBGTMS` 35%.
   - **Hold**: 0% on most inputs (clock-skew budget only).
   - **Output valid (max % of t_cyc)**: `ADDR` 90%, control (`WRITE/SIZE/PROT/LOCK`) 90%, `TRANS` 50%, `WDATA` 40%, `DBGTDO` 20%, debug control 40%, debug status 40%, coprocessor control 80%.
2. Off-chip JTAG path needs the 3-stage TCK synchronizer (§30.23.9) and the `RTCK`-handshake convention.

## 30.27 Conformance tests (amends §27)

1. Each cycle test cites a specific TRM table (§30.18). Regressions stay traceable.
2. Worst-case-FIQ-latency cycle test targeting 27 cycles (§30.14.4).
3. CHAIN/RANGE coupling reference cases (TRM §5.26):
   - "Break on address Y only when process X is running" (CHAIN: WP1 matches process-ID location with `data=X` ⇒ `CHAINOUT` enables WP0).
   - "Break on first 256 bytes but not first 32" (RANGE: WP1 disabled, mask `0x1F`; WP0 enabled, mask `0xFF`, RANGE bit cleared).
4. `MSR` T-bit-write policy test — verify the implementation matches its documented choice (drop vs honor; §30.8.3).
5. Software-breakpoint replication test for Thumb — verify both halfwords of the 32-bit data-value register match.
6. `ABORT`-during-I-cycle ignored — explicit negative test.
7. Unexecuted-instruction `+S` cycle (§30.18.16) as a smoke test.

# 31. Release-readiness audit and immutable sign-off contract

This section answers two different questions that the earlier roadmap mixed together:

1. Does source code for a feature exist?
2. Is that feature correct, interoperable, synthesized, and proven well enough to ship?

At the audited baseline, the answer to the first question is often "partly"; the answer
to the second is **no**. The repository is a useful prototype, but it is not yet a
conformant ARM7TDMI-S replacement or drop-in MiSTer component. This section is the
authoritative backlog for changing that answer.

## 31.0 What "complete" and "drop-in" mean

The v1.0 release has two required, versioned integration surfaces:

1. **`arm7tdmis_top` conformance profile** — an ARM7TDMI-S r4p3-compatible soft
   macrocell: ARMv4T programmer's model, documented r4p3 cycle behavior, memory bus,
   external coprocessor protocol, CP14 DCC, EmbeddedICE-RT, JTAG scan chains, and the
   documented ETM-facing signals. CP15 is not built into a bare ARM7TDMI-S; an external
   system coprocessor may claim p15 through the coprocessor interface.
2. **`arm7tdmi_mister` integration profile** — a stable FPGA wrapper around the CPU
   with a conventional request/completion memory interface, MiSTer-style clock-enable
   operation, reset/interrupt synchronization contract, optional debug tie-offs,
   complete file manifest, timing constraints, and save/restore support. A
   PocketStation reference integration and one generic SoC example prove the contract.

The FPGA profile may compile out ASIC production-test scan logic and an ETM macrocell,
but it must expose honest tie-offs and document that those blocks are **OUT OF SCOPE**.
Merely exposing `SE/SI/SO` while tying `SO` low is not an implementation. The ETM7
macrocell itself is not required; all signals that the r4p3 core promises to an external
ETM are required and tested.

"Drop-in" means compatible with those two published interfaces. It cannot mean
compatible with every unknown future core without an adapter. After v1.0 sign-off, this
ledger is frozen; a new consumer requirement opens a versioned v1.x/v2 task instead of
retroactively invalidating v1.0.

### Authoritative source hierarchy

Before changing behavior, freeze exact copies and SHA-256 hashes of:

1. [ARM Architecture Reference Manual ARM DDI 0100I](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5f8dacc8f86e16515cdb865a),
   restricted to ARMv4T behavior.
2. The in-repository [ARM7TDMI-S r4p3 TRM](ARM_DDI_0234B_ARM7TDMI-S_r4p3_TRM.pdf),
   ARM DDI 0234B.
3. [ARM7TDMI-S Errata List FR002-PRDC-002719 7.0](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5ed62dc5ca06a95ce53f9214)
   (20 March 2009).
4. [ARM Application Note 99, ARM DAI 0099C](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5ed1094dca06a95ce53f8a9d),
   for CP15 and TAP identification.
5. The applicable IEEE 1149.1 revision for TAP behavior.
6. The versioned MiSTer wrapper specification created by §31.9.
7. The PocketStation hardware references selected by the reference integration.

The ARM ARM defines architectural instruction behavior; the r4p3 TRM defines this
implementation's pins, pipeline, timing, and debug; the errata list supersedes known
errors and records real-r4p3 deviations. Any conflict gets a written decision and a
directed test. No test may cite README prose as its specification.

The default release implements architecturally corrected behavior. Maintain an errata
matrix that says whether each real-r4p3 defect is corrected or deliberately reproduced;
if software compatibility requires a defect, put it behind an explicit synthesis
parameter and test both settings.

## 31.1 Audited baseline status

| Area | Status at `23bb86a` | Audit evidence / reason |
|---|---|---|
| Synthesizable source structure | IMPLEMENTED, UNVERIFIED | RTL elaborates and Verilator lint completes, but there is no synthesis result. |
| ARM decode/execute | PARTIAL | Broad class coverage exists; flag, PC, PSR, alignment, translated-transfer, reserved-encoding, and abort defects remain. |
| Thumb decode/execute | PARTIAL | A decoder for 19 formats exists, but most formats lack integration coverage and edge encodings are wrong or untested. |
| Modes and banked registers | IMPLEMENTED, UNVERIFIED | Unit tests cover ordinary banking, not every exception/debug/user-bank interaction. |
| Exceptions and interrupts | INCORRECT | LR offsets, simultaneous priority/interlock, and block-abort behavior conflict with DDI 0234B. |
| Memory bus and cycle accuracy | INCORRECT | N/S/I/C waveforms are not checked; endianness is unused; several timing paths do not match the tables. |
| Multiplier | PARTIAL | Arithmetic and some timing paths exist; flag commit and full m/operand/unpredictable space are not proven. |
| External coprocessor interface | INCORRECT | `CPB` is unused, accepted operations have no transfer body, `CPnTRANS` has the wrong meaning, and pipeline-follow timing is not implemented. |
| CP14 DCC | INCORRECT | c0 is used as a shared data register; real c0 control/c1 RX/TX semantics, handshakes, status pins, and `DbgAbt` are absent. |
| CP15 | INCORRECT / EXTRA | A fabricated internal Main ID is returned by an overly broad decode even though a bare ARM7TDMI-S has no CP15. |
| EmbeddedICE-RT | PARTIAL | The RTL calls itself a scaffold; monitor mode, phase-correct data watchpoints, debug-abort handling, and conformant debug execution are absent. |
| JTAG | PARTIAL | A TAP skeleton and basic IDCODE/BYPASS tests exist; scan-chain semantics, DBGEN gating, synchronization, and end-to-end debug are incomplete. |
| ETM-facing behavior | PARTIAL | Two pins exist; commit semantics, pipeline-follow information, reset/tie-offs, and an ETM-facing checker are absent. |
| DFT wrapper | MISSING | `SO` is tied low and `SE/SI` are unused. It must be removed from the FPGA claim or implemented for a separate ASIC profile. |
| Unit verification | PARTIAL | Ten tests run, but `ice_rt_tb` and `jtag_tap_tb` only print failures and still exit successfully. |
| Integration verification | NOT TRUSTWORTHY / CURRENTLY FAILING | All directed benches print failures then call `$finish`; `make` can report success after a failed check. On 2026-07-28, `make unit integ run` exited 0 while smoke printed two failures: SWPB result expected `0x05`, got `0x0d`, and committed PC expected `0x9c`, got `0x96`. The smoke bench is not in `make integ`. |
| Architectural/cycle conformance | MISSING | No independent reference model, full encoding matrix, bus-cycle scoreboard, coverage closure, formal proof, or real conformance suite. |
| Quartus / FPGA closure | MISSING | No QSF/QIP/IP manifest, synthesis, fit, resource, Fmax, CDC/RDC, or hardware result. The SDC names a nonexistent `DBGTCK` port and false-paths synchronous IRQ/FIQ pins. |
| MiSTer integration | MISSING | No MiSTer wrapper, request/completion bridge, build, save-state interface, PocketStation boot test, or generic integration example. |
| Documentation | INCORRECT | README/AGENTS/docs call scaffolded or untested paths "complete" and document incorrect abort/cycle/CP behavior. |

The useful accomplishments are therefore narrower than the old status pages claim:
the repository has a substantial synthesizable RTL prototype, broad decoder/datapath
scaffolding, a pin-oriented top level, ten unit benches, fifteen directed benches plus
a separate smoke bench, and a runnable Verilator flow. Those are foundations, not
conformance evidence.

## 31.2 P0 — make the evidence fail hard

No functional claim can become VERIFIED until every item here is complete.

- [x] **VER-001:** Replace every error-counter-only test ending with `$finish` with
  `$fatal(1, ...)` on any error and `$finish` only on success. This includes every
  integration bench, the smoke bench, `ice_rt_tb`, and `jtag_tap_tb`. Every
  manifest-listed unit, integration, and smoke top now has a fatal failure path.
- [x] **VER-002:** Add a bounded timeout that fails nonzero to every bench.
  Every manifest-listed bench has an independent `$fatal` timeout.
- [x] **VER-003:** Make one `regress` target run RTL lint, TB lint, all unit tests, all
  directed integration tests, and the smoke test from a clean build. The
  `scripts/Makefile` manifests exactly match every unit and directed integration
  test top, and `make -C scripts regress` orders clean, both lint passes, unit,
  integration, and smoke execution.
- [x] **VER-004:** Make stale cached binaries impossible to mistake for a new result;
  record the RTL git hash, tool versions, build variant, seed, and test manifest in the
  regression output. `scripts/regression_harness.py` starts every full/quick run
  with `clean`, records the Git commit and dirty-source SHA-256, tool/platform
  versions, variant, seed, and complete manifest, then hashes every phase log in
  the atomic `arm7tdmis-regression-v1` JSON result.
- [ ] **VER-005:** Run a harness self-test in CI that deliberately corrupts one expected
  result and proves the overall command fails. Add periodic mutation testing for major
  writeback, flag, exception, and bus controls. The local regression now always
  runs `tb/harness/expected_failure_tb.sv` and passes only when its real
  simulator `$fatal` propagates nonzero; CI wiring and architectural-control
  mutation jobs remain open.
- [ ] **VER-006:** Treat assertions and simulator errors as fatal. Remove unsupported
  warning suppressions or give each one an owner, rationale, and expiry.
- [x] **VER-007:** Stop treating `ABORT` during I/C as illegal testbench stimulus.
  Assert that the core ignores it there, as the TRM requires.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_abort_inactive_tb.sv` injects ABORT during I/C
  phases, while `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_abort_clken_tb.sv` covers an inactive
  assertion overlapping a stopped clock-enable interval.
- [ ] **VER-008:** Publish machine-readable regression and coverage reports as release
  artifacts. A console line containing `PASS` is not release evidence. The
  versioned regression JSON schema and per-phase log hashes are implemented and
  documented in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`; coverage generation and release-artifact
  archival remain open.
- [ ] **VER-009:** Expose a verification-only architectural retirement interface
  (instruction PC/opcode/state/condition result/register and CPSR effects/exception)
  instead of making all scoreboards depend on private hierarchy.
- [x] **VER-010:** Minimize and resolve both currently failing smoke checks. The SWPB
  check may itself be stale because later test code writes r12=13; decide RTL versus
  expectation only from an instruction trace and cited architecture behavior. Likewise,
  explain/fix the final `pc_q=0x96` versus expected `0x9c`. Preserve each real defect as
  a small fail-hard regression. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_swpb_data_tb.sv`
  isolates SWPB read data, lane placement, and LOCK lifetime and proved the old
  r12 expectation stale. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_bx_interwork_tb.sv`
  isolated the odd-address Thumb-to-ARM return defect; destination-state refill
  fixed the final self-loop PC. The original smoke bench now passes fail-hard.

## 31.3 P0 — ARMv4T architectural correctness

Build a requirements/encoding matrix covering every valid ARM and Thumb encoding,
every reserved hole, every condition, register choice, shift amount, addressing mode,
and defined boundary value. Each row links ARM ARM text to RTL and at least one test.

- [x] **ISA-001:** Fix immediate `LSR #0` and `ASR #0` to mean shift by 32, and verify
  `ROR #0` as RRX. Cover immediate and register-specified 0/1/31/32/>32 amounts and
  carry behavior in both states. `tb/unit/shifter_tb.sv` exhausts every boundary
  amount and both carry inputs through the shared ARM/Thumb datapath;
  `tb/unit/decoder_tb.sv` proves the three ARM encoded-zero cases and the distinct
  register-shift-zero path; `tb/unit/thumb_decoder_tb.sv` proves Thumb immediate
  LSR/ASR zero and register-shift selection.
- [x] **ISA-002:** Honor the ALU/shifter flag-write mask. Logical/test/move/shift
  instructions preserve V; arithmetic writes NZCV; instructions whose S bit is clear
  preserve all flags. `tb/unit/alu_tb.sv` checks every logical/test/move and
  arithmetic ALU operation and its exact per-flag mask, while
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_flags_preserve_tb.sv` observes the resulting CPSR through
  MRS after an overflowing arithmetic operation, a logical/move S operation, and an
  S-clear arithmetic operation.
- [x] **ISA-003:** Commit N/Z correctly for `UMLALS` and `SMLALS` after the final
  accumulated 64-bit result. Cover all six multiply forms, S/non-S, aliasing, signed
  extrema, and m=1/2/3/4 timing. The final flag commit occurs in `S_MULL_ACC`;
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_mull_flags_tb.sv` distinguishes the final accumulated
  value from the premature low-half/product value, and the reset-per-row
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_multiply_matrix_tb.sv` executes 19 architectural rows
  covering every form and S setting, zero/nonzero N/Z, C/V preservation, defined
  overlaps, both signed endpoints, and all four m timings. The combinational
  cross-check remains in `tb/unit/multiplier_tb.sv`.
- [x] **ISA-004:** Enforce PSR privilege rules: User mode may change CPSR flags only;
  SPSR access in User/System and writes to invalid modes follow the selected
  UNPREDICTABLE policy; reserved x/s fields are preserved/SBZP; the MSR T-bit policy is
  frozen and tested. `docs/PSR.md` freezes the deterministic policy.
  `tb/unit/psr_policy_tb.sv` seeds nonzero reserved storage and directly proves every
  mask, validity, privilege, RAZ/WI, and restore rule.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_psr_policy_tb.sv` executes the same contract through
  ARM instructions in Supervisor, FIQ, User, and System modes, proves an MSR T-bit
  attempt never changes fetch state, and checks its one-cycle TRM Table 7-6 timing.
- [x] **ISA-005:** Correct every r15 operand value: normal ARM/Thumb reads, ARM
  register-specified shift (+12 case), store-data r15, branch link, PC-relative Thumb
  operations, and debug-state instructions. The reset-per-program
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_pc_operands_tb.sv` checks ordinary ARM +8, the distinct
  register-controlled-shift Rm +12 value, scalar and block-store +12 data, BL link,
  ordinary Thumb +4, and word-aligned Thumb literal/ADD bases at a halfword address.
  The block-store path now uses the latched instruction PC rather than accidentally
  borrowing the following decode-stage PC. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_r15_tb.sv`
  and `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_reg_r15_tb.sv` prove MCR r15 +12 and MRC r15
  NZCV-only semantics. Public-scan debug PC accounting, including DBGRQ,
  breakpoint/watchpoint, exception, debug-speed, system-speed, scan-loaded r15, and
  RESTART, remains exact in the DBG-007/JTAG-005 regressions.
- [x] **ISA-006:** Align every PC write according to the destination state. Cover BX
  both directions, data-processing-to-PC, LDR/LDM-to-PC, POP PC, and exception return.
  A CPSR-restoring PC write must use the restored T bit for its first refill.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_pc_write_alignment_tb.sv` is an 11-row reset-per-case
  matrix with deliberately nonzero discarded address bits. It checks the public
  first-target fetch address and SIZE plus the Execute PC/state for ordinary and
  register-shift ARM DP writes, Thumb DP writes, LDR, LDM, POP, both BX directions,
  MOVS-to-PC restoring ARM and Thumb, and LDM^-to-PC restoring Thumb. PC values are
  masked before reaching the raw address pins; restored SPSR.T selects both that mask
  and the first-refill width. The register-shift path latches its result and restore
  intent through `S_DP_SHIFT`, eliminating its former next-instruction datapath
  dependency. Existing interworking, LDM return, exception, timing, and debug-PC
  regressions pass unchanged.
- [x] **ISA-007:** Treat Thumb conditional-branch condition `1110` as Undefined, not
  AL. Treat ARM condition `1111` according to ARMv4T (not later unconditional
  encodings). `tb/unit/reserved_decode_tb.sv` exhausts all 4,096 combinations of
  the ARM ARM-defined decode bits `[27:20]`/`[7:4]`, anchors the expected class
  totals (including 445 Undefined rows), repeats all 4,096 rows under
  `cond=1111`, and exhausts all 65,536 Thumb halfwords (5,120 ARMv4T-reserved
  words). Non-decode SBZ/SBO violations that share an allocated decode row are
  architecturally UNPREDICTABLE and remain in ISA-016 rather than being
  mislabeled Undefined. The decoder now rejects signed-store/doubleword,
  unallocated multiply/control/media, and ARMv5 coprocessor-extension holes
  before any execute or external-coprocessor side effect. ARMv4 defines
  `cond=1111` as UNPREDICTABLE; the frozen implementation policy is a precise
  Undefined trap for every lower encoding, never an ARMv5+ unconditional
  instruction. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_reserved_execute_tb.sv` independently
  executes 12 reset-per-case representatives and checks exact ARM/Thumb LR and
  SPSR values, ARM-state handler entry, successor flush, memory preservation,
  and absence of external `CPnI`.
- [x] **ISA-008:** Implement translated post-indexed loads/stores (`LDRT/STRT`,
  `LDRBT/STRBT`) with User-mode `PROT` while retaining the current processor
  mode. The original “applicable extra-transfer encodings” clause was inaccurate:
  ARM Addressing Mode 3 requires `P=0,W=0`; `P=0,W=1` is UNPREDICTABLE and
  does not encode an ARMv4T translated halfword/signed transfer. The existing
  directed program covers the four immediate-offset mnemonics.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_translated_ls_matrix_tb.sv` adds 16 reset-per-case
  rows covering word/byte, load/store, add/subtract, and immediate/scaled-register
  post-index forms. Every row checks the original base as the transfer address,
  post-index writeback, load/store data and width, User `PROT`, continued
  privileged opcode fetches, and unchanged Supervisor mode.
- [x] **ISA-009:** Freeze exact ARM7TDMI unaligned-access behavior for word,
  halfword, signed-halfword, signed-byte, SWP, and instruction fetches; verify all
  address low bits in both endian modes. ARMv4T `LDR` and the read half of `SWP`
  now rotate the naturally aligned memory word right by
  `8 * effective_address[1:0]`; `STR` and the write half of `SWP` retain the
  aligned-memory rule. Architecturally UNPREDICTABLE odd `LDRH/LDRSH/STRH`
  accesses have an explicitly non-architectural ISA-016 policy matching the
  r4p3 pin behavior: present the calculated address, ignore `ADDR[0]` in the
  memory system, and select the halfword using `ADDR[1]`. The fail-hard
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_unaligned_access_matrix_tb.sv` executes 64 data/SWP
  rows (eight access classes x four low-bit values x both endian modes) plus
  eight BX-driven instruction-fetch rows. It checks results, sign extension,
  stores, exact raw address/size/direction, both locked SWP cycles, endian lanes,
  destination state, and word/halfword fetch alignment.
- [x] **ISA-010:** Verify every load/store P/U/B/W/L combination, immediate and shifted
  register offset, base/destination alias, writeback, r15 use, and defined/
  UNPREDICTABLE case. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_single_ls_matrix_tb.sv`
  executes all 64 Addressing Mode 2 combinations (P/U/B/W/L x
  immediate/register), including LSL, LSR, ASR, and encoded-RRX shifter paths, and
  checks the exact data-cycle pins, privilege, data, destination, and base
  update. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_extra_ls_matrix_tb.sv` independently
  executes all 64 Addressing Mode 3 rows (STRH/LDRH/LDRSB/LDRSH x P/U/W x
  immediate/register). `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_single_ls_policy_tb.sv`
  adds 26 reset-per-case rows for defined aliases and r15 values plus every
  statically detectable unsafe Rn/Rd/Rm/writeback combination class. The selected
  ISA-016 policy takes a precise Undefined trap before any would-be data
  cycle; defined aliases retain their architectural result. Mode 2 `ROR #0`
  now selects RRX in the shared shifter control.
- [x] **ISA-011:** Verify LDM/STM IA/IB/DA/DB, S/W/L, all 16 register-list bits,
  user-bank forms, PC-in-list CPSR restore, base-in-list rules, and a documented empty
  list policy. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_block_ls_matrix_tb.sv` executes 256
  one-hot rows (P/U/W/L x every r0-r15 list bit) plus 16 eight-register rows
  spanning IA/IB/DA/DB, W, and L; every row checks address order, N/S transfer
  classification, data order, privilege, LOCK, writeback, and r15 behavior.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_block_ls_policy_tb.sv` adds 21 reset-per-case rows
  for privileged User-bank LDM/STM (including STM^ with r15), both LDM^+PC
  writeback forms and CPSR restore, and all base/list policies. STM with the
  writeback base lowest stores the original base; a non-lowest base stores the
  deterministic updated value. LDM with writeback and its base in the list keeps
  the r4p3-compatible Base Updated result. Empty lists, Rn=r15, invalid S/W
  forms, and S forms in User/System take the project-wide precise Undefined
  trap before any data beat. `arm7tdmis_stm_base_list_tb` independently covers
  the defined STM base-lowest rule in all four addressing modes, while
  `arm7tdmis_ldm_pc_tb`, `arm7tdmis_pc_write_alignment_tb`, and the per-beat
  abort/base-list regressions preserve the neighboring return and abort rules.
- [ ] **ISA-012:** Verify SWP/SWPB data, alignment, endian lanes, register aliasing,
  atomicity, and abort behavior.
- [ ] **ISA-013:** Prove condition-failed ARM instructions have exactly the documented
  bus cycle and no register, CPSR/SPSR, memory, lock, coprocessor, or exception side
  effect. Include a condition-failed undefined instruction before SWI and PABT.
- [ ] **ISA-014:** Verify all exception-return idioms (`MOVS/SUBS PC`, LDM with
  `S+PC`) from every exception mode and return to ARM and Thumb.
- [ ] **ISA-015:** Test instruction sequences, not only isolated opcodes: forwarding/
  dependency pairs, self-modifying stores under the documented memory contract,
  back-to-back PC changes, back-to-back MRC, and mode/bank transitions. Include an
  interrupt/exception between Thumb BL prefix and suffix and an orphan suffix; prove
  whether architectural LR alone carries all required inter-halfword state.
- [ ] **ISA-016:** Give every architecturally UNPREDICTABLE case a stable policy
  (`trap`, deterministic result, or real-r4p3 behavior). Tests must never accidentally
  elevate that chosen behavior into an ARM architectural guarantee.
- [ ] **ISA-017:** Exhaustively verify the 31 physical GPRs and six SPSRs across
  User/System/FIQ/IRQ/SVC/Abort/Undefined, including FIQ r8–r14 banking, User/System
  sharing, `^` transfers from every privileged mode, mode changes, and inaccessible/
  UNKNOWN SPSR cases.

## 31.4 P0 — exceptions, reset, and aborts

- [ ] **EXC-001:** Generate the exact saved LR for the source state and exception:
  ARM SWI/UNDEF +4, Thumb SWI/UNDEF +2, PABT/IRQ/FIQ +4, and DABT +8. Cover every
  exception from ARM and Thumb.
- [ ] **EXC-002:** Implement and prove the simultaneous priority
  Reset > DABT > FIQ > IRQ > PABT > UNDEF > SWI. Lower-priority pending events must
  be retained or discarded exactly as specified, not merely lost in an `if` chain.
- [ ] **EXC-003:** Implement the DABT+FIQ interlock: enter Abort first, then vector to
  FIQ. An abort must not spuriously set CPSR.F merely because FIQ was coincident.
- [ ] **EXC-004:** Correct LDM abort behavior: complete the instruction, suppress the
  aborting and every later destination write, preserve r15, and perform requested base
  writeback. Test abort on every beat and base-in-list restoration rules.
- [ ] **EXC-005:** Correct STM abort behavior: requested base writeback completes.
  Test abort on every beat and verify which stores reached memory.
- [ ] **EXC-006:** Verify single LDR/STR abort behavior for every pre/post-index and
  writeback form: requested base modification still occurs, a load destination is not
  overwritten, and no later side effect leaks from the aborted instruction.
- [ ] **EXC-007:** Reconcile SWP's read-only abort requirement with the external bus
  contract. Once a read abort occurs, do not issue/commit the write and do not change
  the destination.
- [ ] **EXC-008:** Prove PABT metadata follows the fetched instruction and disappears
  when that instruction is flushed by a branch, exception, condition path, or debug
  event.
- [ ] **EXC-009:** Verify reset while `CLKEN=0`, reset during every multicycle state,
  minimum-low duration, asynchronous assertion/synchronous release contract, initial
  CPSR/mode/banks, architecturally UNKNOWN register values, bus I cycles, and first
  fetch at zero. Document any deterministic FPGA initialization without depending on
  it as architectural behavior.
- [ ] **EXC-010:** Verify synchronous level-sensitive nIRQ/nFIQ sampling, masking,
  persistence, late arrival, CLKEN stalls, simultaneous requests, and minimum/maximum
  latency including the documented 27-cycle case.
- [ ] **EXC-011:** Scoreboard every exception-entry and return bus cycle from Table
  7-16, including address, T state, mode/PROT, TRANS, and discarded prefetched data.

## 31.5 P0 — memory interface and cycle accuracy

Cycle conformance means matching pins on every enabled clock, not matching only the
number of cycles spent in an internal FSM state.

- [ ] **BUS-001:** `CFGBIGEND` data/fetch mapping is implemented and the endian,
  MiSTer-profile, debug-lane, and ISA-009 matrices verify instruction-halfword
  selection, byte/halfword extraction, sign extension, stores, SWP/SWPB, and every
  byte lane in both configurations. The canonical FPGA wrapper makes endianness a
  synthesis parameter. Remaining work is a reusable raw-pin protocol assertion that
  rejects a `CFGBIGEND` change outside reset and an explicit raw-integrator violation
  policy; do not describe the signal as unused.
- [ ] **BUS-002:** Add a phase-aware scoreboard for every clock:
  `ADDR/WRITE/SIZE/PROT/LOCK/TRANS/WDATA/RDATA/ABORT/DMORE`, CP signals, CLKEN, PC,
  CPSR, instruction state, and exception/debug events.
- [ ] **BUS-003:** Re-derive and implement N/S/I/C sequences for every Table 7-2
  category and detailed Table 7-3–7-23 row. Include DP-to-PC, LDR/LDM-to-PC, BX,
  condition fail, exceptions, all multiply m values, and coprocessor busy cases.
- [ ] **BUS-004:** Reconcile Table 7-2's STM `+I` with Table 7-14's visible bus rows in
  a checked design note; do the same for every apparent summary/detail discrepancy.
- [ ] **BUS-005:** Generate N versus S from actual burst history. Reset/redirect/first
  accesses cannot be labeled S merely because they are fetches.
- [ ] **BUS-006:** Verify pipelined address/data phase alignment for reads and writes.
  A stalled cycle must keep every address-class and write-data signal stable and cause
  exactly one architectural completion when CLKEN resumes.
- [ ] **BUS-007:** Sample ABORT only at the specified enabled S/N data or opcode
  phase, ignore it in I/C, and retain the sample across later stalls/phases.
- [ ] **BUS-008:** Verify `PROT[0]` code/data and `PROT[1]` User/privileged for every
  fetch, data access, translated access, exception mode, and debug system-speed access.
- [ ] **BUS-009:** Hold `LOCK` across both SWP data transfers and release it on all
  normal, abort, reset, debug, and stall exits.
- [ ] **BUS-010:** Drive `DMORE` from the current transfer's guaranteed continuation,
  not a loose "block active" flag. Verify first/middle/last/single-beat/stalled/aborted
  LDM and STM.
- [ ] **BUS-011:** Verify burst address increments, control stability, byte
  non-bursting, alignment, reset I cycles, and branch/exception/refill waveforms.
- [ ] **BUS-012:** Publish a precise raw-bus integration contract, including when an
  attached memory samples address, data, ABORT, and CLKEN. Provide a protocol checker
  that downstream cores can instantiate.

## 31.6 P0 — coprocessor and CP14 behavior

- [x] **CP-001:** Remove the fabricated internal CP15 Main ID and its integration
  test. Bare ARM7TDMI/ARM7TDMI-S has no CP15 (ARM DAI 0099C). With `CPA=CPB=1`, p15
  traps Undefined; a system wrapper may attach its own privileged CP15.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp15_undef_tb.sv` proves that an unclaimed p15 MRC
  enters Undefined and does not return a fabricated identification value.
- [x] **CP-002:** Decode all coprocessor classes and opcode fields exactly. CP14
  internal operations must match exact `MRC/MCR p14,0,...` encodings; unsupported CP14
  and CP15 operations trap rather than aliasing a broad `CRn` match.
  Decoder class coverage is in `tb/unit/decoder_tb.sv`; exact supported CP14
  encodings and eight representative aliases are checked by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_decode_tb.sv`, with r15 transfer semantics in
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_r15_tb.sv` and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_reg_r15_tb.sv`.
- [x] **CP-003:** Drive `CPnTRANS=0` in User mode and 1 in privileged modes. It is
  not an inverse code/data signal.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cpntrans_tb.sv` checks User, System, Supervisor,
  IRQ, and FIQ opcode/data phases.
- [x] **CP-004:** Register CP pipeline-follow signals according to previous/current
  `CPnOPC/CPnMREQ/CPTBIT` rules and CLKEN. Verify ARM fetch, Thumb, stalls, flushes,
  condition fail, and back-to-back CP instructions.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_pipeline_follow_tb.sv` implements an independent
  previous/current-cycle follower and covers every listed case.
- [x] **CP-005:** Implement CPA/CPB absent, accepted-ready, accepted-busy, completion,
  and late-abandonment protocols for CDP/MCR/MRC/LDC/STC. Accepted instructions cannot
  silently become no-ops.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_cdp_protocol_tb.sv`,
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_reg_transfer_tb.sv`, and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_ldc_stc_tb.sv` cover all instruction classes and
  absent/ready/busy/completion behavior.
- [x] **CP-006:** Implement C cycles and MRC/MCR data timing; implement variable-length
  LDC/STC transfers, writeback, `CPSEQ`, aborts, and interrupt/DBGRQ abandonment with
  idempotent busy waits.
  Data timing and C cycles are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_reg_transfer_tb.sv`; variable transfer length,
  N/S termination, `CPSEQ`, direction, and writeback by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_ldc_stc_tb.sv`; every-word LDC/STC abort injection
  by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_ldc_stc_abort_tb.sv`; and late IRQ, FIQ, and
  DBGRQ abandonment by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_busy_interrupt_tb.sv` and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_busy_dbgrq_tb.sv`.
- [x] **CP-007:** Implement separate DCC RX and TX buffers. Exact behavior:
  c0 control read; c1 data read/write; W/R ownership transitions; no unintended
  round-trip through a shared storage word.
  The public CP14/JTAG round trip is verified by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_dcc_tb.sv`; independent storage, ownership,
  processor-side CLKEN behavior, and both simultaneous producer/consumer races are
  verified by `tb/unit/dcc_tb.sv`.
- [x] **CP-008:** Return the selected exact-r4p3 DCC version (`0111` under the default
  profile), implement DCC single-access scan-chain-2 behavior, and verify control reads
  through both CP14 and JTAG.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_dcc_tb.sv` checks the exact `0x70000000` control
  value through both interfaces and checks the data-response address bit with W both
  set and clear.
- [x] **CP-009:** Implement sticky CP14 Abort Status `DbgAbt`, debug-vs-external-abort
  priority, software clear, and exact register encoding.
  Exact c2 decode, sticky set, software clear, set-over-clear priority, and reset are
  covered by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_decode_tb.sv` and `tb/unit/dcc_tb.sv`.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_monitor_mode_tb.sv` covers architectural c2 reads
  after monitor-generated Prefetch and Data Aborts and proves that coincident external
  instruction/data aborts win without setting `DbgAbt`.
- [x] **CP-010:** Drive `DBGCOMMRX` high for a full RX buffer and `DBGCOMMTX` high for
  an empty TX buffer, both gated by DBGEN. Verify every host/processor race and reset.
  `tb/unit/dcc_tb.sv` covers reset, CLKEN, and both ownership races;
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_dcc_tb.sv` covers the public pins through both
  directions and gates/restores each pending-data state with DBGEN.
- [x] **CP-011:** Decide and test the release policy for r4p3 errata [14]
  (non-indexed LDC/STC decode) and [15] (sequential MRC timing).
  The frozen release policy is corrected behavior with no defect-emulation
  parameter: unindexed LDC/STC forms execute architecturally, and every
  consecutive MRC executes independently. The exact affected encodings and
  early-CPA/CPB timing are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_erratum14_tb.sv` and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp_erratum15_tb.sv`. See
  `docs/COPROCESSOR.md`.

## 31.7 P0/P1 — EmbeddedICE-RT, JTAG, and ETM-facing behavior

- [x] **DBG-001:** Replace the scaffold debug FSM with conformant halt and monitor
  modes. Implement Debug Control bits 5:0, Debug Status bits 4:0, IFEN/INTDIS, Debug
  Abort Status, DBGRQ/DBGBREAK priority, the exact Table 5-1 register map, and all
  DBGEN gating. Follow each pin's specified sampling/synchronization behavior rather
  than applying a blanket two-flop policy. ARM7TDMI-S r4p3 has no Vector Catch
  register: address `0x02` and every other unlisted slot are reserved.
  Same-edge external DBGBREAK sampling, opcode pipeline tagging/restart, and a
  final-beat LDM data watchpoint are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_external_break_tb.sv`. Synchronous external
  DBGRQ sampling, control-bit-1 Run-Test/Idle synchronization, internal-DBGACKI
  status semantics, INTDIS, register width, and RAZ behavior are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_control_sync_tb.sv`. Watchpoint priority over
  simultaneous DBGRQ and watchpoint interaction with Data Abort, IRQ, and FIQ are
  covered by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_watchpoint_priority_tb.sv`.
  A Prefetch Abort on the breakpointed fetch is proven to discard the
  breakpoint without debug entry by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_breakpoint_pabt_tb.sv`. Coincident
  one-cycle IRQ and FIQ requests are retained through their banked-state
  transition and vector fetch by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_breakpoint_interrupt_tb.sv`; DBGRQ with
  Undefined, bounced-coprocessor, Prefetch Abort, and load/store Data Abort
  is covered by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_dbgrq_exception_tb.sv`.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_reserved_regs_tb.sv` writes and reads every
  reserved register address through public JTAG, requires deterministic RAZ/WI
  behavior, and proves that address `0x02` cannot create a false vector breakpoint.
  These benches cover every architecturally reachable halt-mode
  breakpoint/watchpoint exception collision. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_dbgen_sources_tb.sv`
  completes the DBGEN matrix: public JTAG preloads forced DBGACK, INTDIS, monitor
  mode, an instruction breakpoint, and a data watchpoint before DBGEN is lowered;
  held DBGRQ/DBGBREAK/DBGEXT cannot stop either matched access or inhibit the
  selected IRQ/FIQ, and every gated output remains LOW. Together with
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_dbgen_gating_tb.sv`, the DCC integration test,
  and the comparator unit test, this covers every documented §5.7/Appendix A
  disable effect.
- [x] **DBG-002:** Feed Debug Status TRANS from the actual `TRANS[1]`, not PROT.
  Align address/control and read/write data before data-dependent watchpoint comparison.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_status_tb.sv` discriminates live `TRANS[1]`
  from privileged `PROT[1]` during both an active stalled transfer and debug halt.
  `tb/unit/ice_watchpoint_tb.sv` poisons the next address/control phase while checking
  the prior transfer's read/write data, and repeats the check across CLKEN stalls.
- [x] **DBG-003:** Implement exact WP0/WP1 value/mask, XNOR, size, read/write,
  opcode/data, privilege, EXTERN, CHAIN latch, RANGE, and ENABLE semantics. Figure
  5-13 contains no T comparator field; TBIT is Debug Status bit 4, not a watchpoint
  qualifier. `DBGRNG` remains independent of ENABLE but is disabled by DBGEN.
  `tb/unit/ice_watchpoint_tb.sv` covers both units, every control field, address/data
  XNOR masks, data-phase alignment, CLKEN, ENABLE independence, DBGEN/control-disable,
  and CHAIN/RANGE coupling. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_software_breakpoint_tb.sv`
  programs the §5.21.2 sequence through public JTAG and covers ARM plus both Thumb
  bus lanes and adjacent-halfword false positives in both endiannesses. The unit
  regression also implements the TRM's first-256-except-first-32 RANGE recipe and
  sets CHAINOUT before proving that `DBGnTRST` clears it without a clock edge.
- [x] **DBG-004:** Qualify breakpoints with valid, non-flushed instructions.
  Watchpoints enter debug only after the access and all architectural writeback
  complete; cover LDM/STM, aborts, exceptions, and simultaneous DBGRQ.
  Internal opcode execute/restart and flush cancellation are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_breakpoint_execute_tb.sv` and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_breakpoint_flush_tb.sv`. Internal and external
  multibeat LDM completion are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_watchpoint_completion_tb.sv` and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_external_break_tb.sv`.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_watchpoint_priority_tb.sv` covers final-beat
  STM completion and base writeback, external Data Abort precedence, retained
  one-cycle IRQ/FIQ, and simultaneous DBGRQ. Its exception cases require the mode,
  LR, and SPSR transition plus the first vector fetch before DBGACK, while
  proving that neither the vector instruction nor the post-watchpoint
  instruction executes.
- [x] **DBG-005:** Implement monitor-mode restrictions and generated PABT/DABT,
  including `DbgAbt` and external ABORT precedence.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_monitor_mode_tb.sv` programs the mode and
  comparators through public JTAG, covers generated PABT/DABT without halt or DBGACK,
  ignores external DBGBREAK, reads CP14 c2, and covers external instruction/data abort
  priority. `tb/unit/ice_watchpoint_tb.sv` covers Debug Control bit 5, permitted
  `DBGEXT` qualification, and fail-closed data-dependent, RANGE, and CHAIN
  configurations.
- [x] **DBG-006:** Replace the fixed eight-cycle injection window with an explicit
  instruction accepted/retired handshake. Debug-speed and system-speed execution must
  support wait states and every allowed multicycle instruction, including 16-register
  LDM/STM, without fetching or retiring an extra normal instruction. Halt only at a
  legal boundary; do not freeze and repeatedly present an unfinished external bus
  transfer. The explicit handshake is fail-hard covered at debug speed by a stalled
  12-register writeback LDM plus stalled 16-register STMIB/LDMIB transfers in
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_inject_handshake_tb.sv` and at
  system speed by a stalled LDR with temporary `DBGACK`, interrupt masking, and
  automatic re-entry checks in `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_system_speed_tb.sv`;
  OpenOCD's MRS/MSR/STR PSR transfer is covered in
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_register_scan_tb.sv`. The maximum block
  transfers cover all 16 external beats, architectural r0-r14 effects, r15
  store/load, and restart from the loaded r15 value.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_inject_matrix_tb.sv` completes the §5.16.1
  debug-speed class matrix with all 16 data-processing opcodes, the
  register-controlled-shift extra cycle, every scalar load/store width and
  signedness, SWP/SWPB, and CPSR/SPSR MRS/MSR. Its 38 ordinary injected words
  each require exactly one accept and retire; every memory family is stalled
  before its response edge and the pending normal instruction stays frozen.
  The system-speed test covers the four permitted at-speed classes—single
  load/store and LDM/STM—including stalls and byte/halfword/word accesses.
- [x] **DBG-007:** Implement debug entry/exit PC formulas, temporary DBGACK behavior,
  pending interrupt preservation, interrupt masking during at-speed execution, and
  the DBGRQ/PC-modify errata policy. Scan-loaded r15 now replaces all stale
  fetch/decode state and the OpenOCD-style branch/RESTART sequence resumes at that
  address without spurious system-speed re-entry; this is fail-hard covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_pc_resume_tb.sv`. The DBGRQ STM capture includes
  the exact three-word scan-pipeline bias and survives OpenOCD's ARM7TDMI-specific
  correction in `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_pc_capture_tb.sv`; the same
  regression verifies the distinct pre-execute breakpoint formula. The normal
  multibeat watchpoint formula is covered alongside completion ordering in
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_watchpoint_completion_tb.sv`. A watchpoint
  collision with a one-cycle IRQ now proves pending-interrupt preservation and
  correct IRQ mode/LR/SPSR/vector entry, and the Data Abort collision proves
  abort-mode entry before debug halt, in
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_watchpoint_priority_tb.sv`. That regression
  also scans r15 after independent Data Abort, IRQ, and FIQ collisions and
  requires the three-address exception-entry correction to recover the fetched
  vector. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_system_speed_tb.sv` compares public
  r15 scans across ordinary debug-speed execution and a stalled at-speed LDR,
  requiring one address per `N` instruction and exactly three per `S`
  instruction. The corrected-default r4p3 erratum [13] policy treats the
  canonical `DBGRQ` input as synchronous, commits every PC modification
  atomically at a legal halt boundary, and retains its destination through
  pipeline refill for the public r15 scan. Asynchronous board/framework
  sources must be synchronized before this interface; no silicon-defect
  compatibility parameter is provided for a condition outside that interface
  contract. `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_pc_modify_dbgrq_tb.sv` covers the
  synchronous boundaries before, during, and after `MOV pc` and during the
  execute, data, and writeback phases of `LDR pc`.
- [x] **JTAG-001:** Exhaustively verify all 16 TAP states and transitions, async
  `DBGnTRST`, Capture/Shift/Update-IR, fixed `0001` capture, all five public
  instructions, and BYPASS for every other IR encoding. Fail-hard evidence:
  `tb/unit/jtag_tap_tb.sv`.
- [x] **JTAG-002:** Verify IDCODE bit fields and configurability. The r4p3
  macrocell value `0x7F1F0F0F` is the compatibility default; synthesized
  products override the version, part, and manufacturer fields through top-level
  parameters while bit 0 remains fixed HIGH. Policy and ownership are documented
  in `docs/DEBUG.md`; default fields/serial order are fail-hard checked by
  `tb/unit/jtag_tap_tb.sv`, and overrides by
  `tb/unit/jtag_idcode_config_tb.sv`.
- [x] **JTAG-003:** Implement and verify SCAN_N selection, chain 0, 33-bit chain 1,
  38-bit chain 2, reserved chains, the TRM-defined physical cell order, update
  atomicity, and chain-1 bit 33's entry-cause/debug-speed/system-speed meanings.
  Selection, widths, reserved-chain behavior, physical order, update atomicity,
  and one-shot breakpoint/watchpoint entry cause are fail-hard verified by
  `tb/unit/jtag_tap_tb.sv` and
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_entry_cause_tb.sv`. The staged bit-33/RESTART
  system-speed sequence, CLKEN stall, temporary `DBGACK`, IRQ masking, automatic
  re-entry, and high re-entry cause are verified by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_system_speed_tb.sv`.
- [x] **JTAG-004:** Gate TMS/TDI/TCKEN/TDO/TDOEN as specified by DBGEN. Implement the
  required TCK synchronization/RTCK convention or publish a proven synchronous-only
  FPGA debug-port wrapper with a different, explicit interface name. DBGEN gating is
  fail-hard verified by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_dbgen_gating_tb.sv`.
  `rtl/jtag/arm7tdmis_sync_debug_port.sv` is the explicitly named,
  same-`CLK` command/response transport: it emits exactly one `DBGTCKEN` event
  for each accepted step and deliberately does not claim asynchronous JTAG
  compatibility. Backpressure, disable/reset isolation, event accounting, and
  a complete default-IDCODE scan through the real TAP are verified by
  `tb/unit/sync_debug_port_tb.sv`; its timing contract is in `docs/DEBUG.md`.
- [x] **JTAG-005:** Run end-to-end scan scripts that halt, read/write every register
  and memory through legal debug instructions, use a system-speed access with stalls,
  restart, exercise DCC both directions, set break/watchpoints, and enter monitor mode.
  The OpenOCD-compatible debug-speed LDM/STM round trip for r0-r14, including
  external-bus isolation, is covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_register_scan_tb.sv`; scan-loaded r15 and the
  branch/RESTART resume path are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_pc_resume_tb.sv`, and DBGRQ r15 capture by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_pc_capture_tb.sv`, which also covers a
  scan-programmed instruction breakpoint; normal data-watchpoint r15 capture is
  covered by `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_watchpoint_completion_tb.sv`.
  OpenOCD-compatible CPSR/SPSR read/write and scan-bus isolation are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_register_scan_tb.sv`. Bidirectional CP14/JTAG DCC,
  including rev-4 single-access status and public status pins, is covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_cp14_dcc_tb.sv`. Public-JTAG word, byte, and halfword
  memory round trips plus a stalled system-speed transfer are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_system_speed_tb.sv`; public-JTAG monitor entry and
  breakpoint/watchpoint programming are covered by
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_debug_monitor_mode_tb.sv`. A real debugger process is the
  separate `JTAG-006` requirement.
- [ ] **JTAG-006:** Demonstrate a pinned open-source debugger/GDB flow against the
  simulated scan transport and on FPGA, or document precisely why the r4p3 scan
  protocol needs a project-specific bridge and release that bridge with protocol tests.
- [ ] **ETM-001:** Define and verify `DBGINSTRVALID` and `DBGnEXEC` for commit,
  condition failure, stalls, multicycle instructions, flushes, exceptions, debug, and
  Thumb. Expose the documented bus/pipeline information required by ETM7.
- [ ] **ETM-002:** Provide and test the external ETM wrapper contract, including direct
  RDATA/WDATA visibility, `PROCID=0`, `PROCIDWR=0`, and reset propagation.
- [ ] **DFT-001:** For the FPGA profile, remove DFT from all "complete" claims and tie
  it off in a named `no_dft` wrapper. If an ASIC profile remains a goal, create a
  separate scan-insertion specification and prove SE/SI/SO rather than tying SO low.

## 31.8 Required r4p3 errata matrix

The release matrix must contain all fifteen entries from
FR002-PRDC-002719 7.0, not only the four that still affect r4p3:

| Erratum | r4p3 status in Arm list | Required project action |
|---|---|---|
| [1] Consecutive breakpoints | Corrected before r4p3 | Regression proving corrected behavior |
| [2] False Undefined exception | Corrected | Regression |
| [3] DBGRQ coincident with exception | Corrected | Regression |
| [4] Breakpoint after exception/watchpointed store | Corrected | Regression |
| [5] Breakpoint after multicycle instruction | Corrected | Regression |
| [6] Watchpoint followed by exception | Corrected | Regression |
| [7] Debug entry coincident with DBGRQ | Corrected | Regression |
| [8] Interrupt during at-speed debug instruction | Corrected in r4p3 | Regression with long LDM/STM |
| [9] wrong ICE version through JTAG | Corrected in r4p3 | Return selected r4p3 value consistently |
| [10] Thumb EIS log error | Corrected / non-synthesized | Ensure project trace logger is correct |
| [11] SWI/PABT after condition-failed Undef | Present in r4p3 | Decide corrected-default vs compatibility parameter |
| [12] Thumb DABT LR low-bit error | Corrected in r4p3 | Regression |
| [13] async DBGRQ during PC modification | Present in r4p3 | Corrected default: synchronous `DBGRQ` contract, atomic PC commit, retained redirect regression; synchronize asynchronous sources externally |
| [14] non-indexed LDC/STC decode | Present in r4p3 | Corrected only: execute P=0,U=1,W=0 LDC/LDCL/STC/STCL architecturally; no defect-emulation parameter; `arm7tdmis_cp_erratum14_tb.sv` |
| [15] sequential MRC timing | Present in r4p3 | Corrected only: execute each consecutive opcode1=x1x MRC independently, including early CPA/CPB; no defect-emulation parameter; `arm7tdmis_cp_erratum15_tb.sv` |

- [ ] **ERR-001:** Vendor/hash the errata list, review every entry's full conditions,
  freeze the policy column, and link each applicable test/result.
- [ ] **ERR-002:** Default to architectural corrections. Any real-silicon defect
  emulation is opt-in, has a named parameter, and is included in regression and docs.

## 31.9 P0 — MiSTer and PocketStation integration

- [x] **MIST-001:** Add a synthesizable `arm7tdmi_mister` wrapper with documented
  request/ready-or-done memory transactions, address, read/write data, byte enables,
  code/data, privilege, lock, sequential/more hints, and abort/error response.
  `rtl/top/arm7tdmi_mister.sv` is the canonical single-outstanding
  valid/ready wrapper and `docs/INTEGRATION.md` is its versioned port/timing
  contract. `make -C scripts lint-mister` elaborates it as a release-facing
  top; `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_mister_wrapper_tb.sv` exercises every
  metadata field and byte-lane class through a real program.
- [x] **MIST-002:** Bridge raw ARM `CLKEN` semantics without gated/generated clocks.
  A request remains stable until completion, slow memory inserts arbitrary waits, and
  each request completes exactly once.
  The wrapper uses only `CLK` and clock enables, has one request slot plus one
  response holding register, and accepts `MEM_READY` independently of
  `CPU_CE`. The integration regression completes the first response while CE
  is low, then randomizes both CE and memory waits while checking full-payload
  stability, exact handshake accounting, and architectural readback.
- [x] **MIST-003:** Define reset and CDC ownership. Synchronize asynchronous board/
  framework signals at the wrapper, keep architecturally synchronous nIRQ/nFIQ clear
  inside the CPU contract, and test reset/interrupt arrival at every phase.
  `docs/INTEGRATION.md` assigns every boundary to `CLK` or an explicitly
  named `_ASYNC` input. The wrapper uses marked two-flop synchronizers for
  active-high IRQ/FIQ and all debug event/policy inputs, then converts only
  the synchronized interrupt levels to raw active-low pins.
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_mister_cdc_reset_tb.sv` injects IRQ/FIQ during
  normal execution, an unready request, and a response buffered with CE low;
  it also asynchronously resets a live request and requires a clean vector-0
  restart.
- [x] **MIST-004:** Parameterize little/big endian and optional debug/coprocessor
  features without changing architectural behavior or leaving floating ports. Compile
  and regress every supported parameter combination.
  `BIG_ENDIAN`, `ENABLE_DEBUG`, and `ENABLE_COPROCESSOR` are synthesis
  parameters with deterministic internal tie-offs. One elaboration of
  `tb/integration/arm7tdmis_mister_profiles_tb.sv` instantiates and executes
  all eight combinations. It checks both external byte-lane maps, a complete
  IDCODE scan versus disabled-debug isolation, and claimed versus
  forced-absent external CDP behavior for each relevant profile.
- [x] **MIST-005:** Add complete `.qip`/file-list/QSF integration fragments and an
  example top that can be consumed without private include paths, hierarchical peeks,
  or hand-edited generated files.
  `fpga/arm7tdmi_mister.{f,qip,qsf,sdc}` and
  `fpga/example/arm7tdmi_mister_example_top.sv` form the portable package.
  `scripts/tests/test_fpga_package.py` proves exact source-manifest parity,
  repository-relative paths, public-fragment references, and absence of
  hierarchy-dependent integration; `make -C scripts lint-example` elaborates
  the complete package as the selected Cyclone V example top, and
  `make -C scripts quartus-analysis` reads the QSF/QIP and successfully
  analyzes/elaborates it with Quartus 17.0.2 for `5CSEBA6U23I7`. All three
  checks are release-regression phases. The trimmed example also has the
  fail-hard fit/timing characterization recorded under FPGA-003.
  `fpga/arm7tdmis_conformance.{qsf,sdc}` separately preserves and fits every
  raw debug, JTAG, coprocessor, trace, endian, and bus boundary. A real
  framework build remains MIST-007.
- [ ] **MIST-006:** Add a versioned architectural state export/import handshake for
  MiSTer save states. Include all visible registers, banked registers, CPSR/SPSRs,
  pipeline and any in-flight bus/debug state (including a snapshot between Thumb BL
  halfwords), or quiesce to a precisely defined snapshot boundary. Verify restore
  determinism.
- [ ] **MIST-007:** Integrate into a real MiSTer framework build targeting the selected
  Cyclone V device. Archive the exact framework commit, build command, timing report,
  resource report, and generated bitstream hash.
- [ ] **MIST-008:** Create a PocketStation reference system using legally supplied/
  user-provided BIOS and software images. Implement or stub the documented SRAM, flash,
  interrupt, timer, LCD, sound, and I/O behavior sufficiently to boot; check milestone
  PCs, memory side effects, display output, and interrupt activity.
- [ ] **MIST-009:** Run a PocketStation soak test with real software and randomized
  memory waits, reset, interrupts, and save/restore. Compare an observable execution
  trace against an independent emulator/reference where behavior is defined.
- [ ] **MIST-010:** Add a second, generic SoC integration example (ROM/RAM/timer/UART)
  so the API is not accidentally PocketStation-specific. Compile it with at least two
  supported open-source FPGA tool/simulator flows where practical.
- [ ] **MIST-011:** Publish maximum CPU rate, master-clock/CE ratios, latency rules,
  resource budget, required memories/DSPs, reset duration, endian configuration, and
  optional-feature costs.
- [ ] **MIST-012:** Test coexistence with DMA/bus arbitration, including SWP LOCK,
  LDM/STM DMORE, stalls, and abort/error responses.
- [ ] **MIST-013:** Supply checked thin adapters from the canonical wrapper interface
  to the selected MiSTer `enable/done` convention and at least one standard FPGA bus
  (Avalon-MM or Wishbone). Keep the CPU contract independent of any one adapter.

## 31.10 P0/P1 — verification closure

- [ ] **VAL-001:** Add an independent ARMv4T instruction reference model or
  differential co-simulation. It must not reuse this RTL's decoder or expected-value
  functions. Normalize documented implementation-defined/UNPREDICTABLE cases.
- [ ] **VAL-002:** Generate constrained-random ARM and Thumb programs with instruction,
  register, flag, mode, memory, exception, alignment, endian, and dependency coverage.
  Compare retirement state and permitted memory effects for long seeded runs.
- [ ] **VAL-003:** Integrate legally redistributable public ARMv4T suites (for example
  ARM/Thumb instruction exercisers used by mature open FPGA cores) after recording
  license, source commit, expected signature, and any patches. Do not claim the
  proprietary Arm Validation Suite was run unless it actually was.
- [ ] **VAL-004:** Replace the current E-state-duration cycle harness with exact
  Chapter 7 waveform tests and cross coverage over class × register/PC × m/n/b ×
  condition × endian × stalls × abort/interrupt.
- [ ] **VAL-005:** Add randomized CLKEN stalls to every instruction class and random
  legal ABORT, IRQ, FIQ, reset, DBGRQ, and coprocessor handshakes at each cycle.
- [ ] **VAL-006:** Add functional coverage for every valid encoding family and every
  specified exceptional/reserved path. Release has zero uncovered required bins; all
  exclusions cite specification text.
- [ ] **VAL-007:** Add formal properties for no ghost commits, condition suppression,
  mode/bank isolation, PC alignment, flag preservation, bus stability under CLKEN,
  one completion per request, LOCK lifetime, exception priority, abort suppression,
  TAP transitions, and CDC/reset assumptions. Under fair memory/coprocessor responses,
  also prove forward progress and absence of deadlock.
- [ ] **VAL-008:** Add bounded formal cover traces for every FSM state/transition and
  every exception/debug entry and return.
- [ ] **VAL-009:** Add software-level compiler tests built with pinned
  `arm-none-eabi` tools for `-march=armv4t`, in ARM, Thumb, and interworked code.
- [ ] **VAL-010:** Run long deterministic fuzz/soak jobs under sanitizing simulator
  settings, X-propagation where supported, and multiple seeds. Archive failing seeds
  and minimize them into directed regressions.
- [ ] **VAL-011:** Have a reviewer independent of the implementation map each
  sign-off requirement to evidence and inspect waveforms for the highest-risk
  exception, bus, coprocessor, and debug cases.

## 31.11 P0/P1 — synthesis, timing, CDC, and FPGA quality

- [x] **FPGA-001:** Fix `scripts/arm7tdmis.sdc`: there is no `DBGTCK` port; the design
  uses `CLK` plus `DBGTCKEN`. Select the actual synthesis top before constraining DFT
  pins. Do not false-path synchronous nIRQ/nFIQ inputs as if the RTL synchronized them.
  The rewritten constraint file explicitly targets `arm7tdmis_top`, defines
  only `CLK`, treats `DBGTCKEN` and raw interrupt/debug controls as
  synchronous inputs, and contains no chip-wrapper DFT pins.
  `scripts/tests/test_sdc_contract.py` checks those invariants and separately
  checks the canonical FPGA wrapper's real clock/async boundary.
- [ ] **FPGA-002:** Choose exact MiSTer/Cyclone V part and board clock. Constrain all
  real clocks, generated enables/interfaces, I/O delays, async controls, reset recovery/
  removal, and legitimate CDC paths. Report zero unconstrained endpoints.
  The portable trimmed characterization now targets `5CSEBA6U23I7`, uses one
  representative global clock at 25 MHz, constrains a documented 0.25-to-5 ns
  synchronous input window and all output boundaries, false-paths only reset and
  two-flop asynchronous event inputs, and reports zero unconstrained setup/hold
  endpoints. This does not close the task: the selected real MiSTer framework's
  PLL clocks, generated clocks, and complete top-level I/O still need constraints.
- [x] **FPGA-003:** Run clean Quartus analysis/synthesis, fit, TimeQuest at all required
  corners, and assembly for both conformance and trimmed MiSTer profiles. Treat critical
  warnings as failures.
  `make -C scripts quartus-compile` closes the trimmed
  `arm7tdmi_mister_example_top` profile, and
  `make -C scripts quartus-conformance-compile` closes the raw,
  feature-complete `arm7tdmis_top` profile in Quartus Lite 17.0.2. In both
  profiles synthesis, fit, assembly, and four-corner TimeQuest complete; all
  setup/hold/pulse-width slacks are nonnegative; the design is fully
  constrained; and a nonempty SOF is emitted.
  `scripts/quartus_report_check.py` rejects missing stages/images, critical
  warnings, ignored constraints, unconstrained endpoints, negative slack, wrong
  top/device, and profile-specific resource-budget overruns. Both full flows
  are mandatory phases of `make -C scripts regress`; quick regression runs
  analysis/elaboration for both.
- [ ] **FPGA-004:** Run an independent synthesizer/linter where supported and CDC/RDC
  analysis. Resolve combinational loops, inferred latches, multiple drivers,
  simulation/synthesis mismatches, unsafe synchronizers, and reset-domain crossings.
- [ ] **FPGA-005:** Verify RAM/DSP/clock-enable inference in reports. Publish ALM,
  register, MLAB/M10K, DSP, clock, power estimate, and Fmax data with budget headroom.
  The trimmed profile currently fits in 3,311 ALMs, 2,611 registers, six DSP
  blocks, and zero memory bits against enforced limits of 5,000/4,096/8/0.
  The full raw profile fits in 4,750 ALMs, 3,766 registers, six DSP blocks,
  and zero memory bits against enforced limits of 7,500/6,000/8/0.
  Optional-feature deltas, explicit clock-enable inference, power, and maximum
  frequency characterization remain open.
- [ ] **FPGA-006:** Prove synthesis equivalence or run post-synthesis simulation for
  architectural smoke, stalls, reset, endian, exceptions, and wrapper transactions.
- [ ] **FPGA-007:** Perform on-board bring-up with an embedded trace/signature test,
  repeatable programming instructions, and captured evidence; then run the
  PocketStation reference integration on hardware.
- [ ] **FPGA-008:** Pin every tool/container version and make the release build
  reproducible from a clean checkout in CI.

## 31.12 Documentation and release hygiene

- [ ] **DOC-001:** Replace all unconditional "Complete", "all green", and
  "cycle-accurate" claims in README, AGENTS, and `docs/` with the §31 status vocabulary
  until linked sign-off evidence exists.
- [ ] **DOC-002:** Correct documentation for LDM/STM aborts, exception priority/LR,
  logical V preservation, PC values, STM/coprocessor cycles, endianness, CP14, absence
  of internal CP15, monitor/debug limitations, ETM, and DFT.
- [ ] **DOC-003:** Create a bidirectional traceability table:
  requirement ID → source section → RTL → directed/random/formal tests → coverage bin
  → latest result. Also prove every RTL feature and every test maps back to a
  requirement.
- [ ] **DOC-004:** Publish the two integration APIs with timing diagrams, reset and
  clock rules, parameter/tie-off tables, error behavior, synthesis examples, and
  compatibility/version policy.
- [ ] **DOC-005:** Record copyright/license/SPDX status for RTL, tests, manuals,
  third-party suites, reference emulator code, MiSTer fragments, firmware, and ROM
  handling. Do not redistribute copyrighted BIOS/software without permission.
- [ ] **DOC-006:** Add a changelog, semantic version, support matrix, known-limitations
  file, security/debug notes, and a release manifest containing source/tool/spec hashes.
- [ ] **DOC-007:** Remove stale "pending", "scaffold", and "deferred" comments only
  when the corresponding requirement is verified; otherwise keep them and link the
  owning task ID.

## 31.13 Final v1.0 release gate

The release owner may sign off only when all statements below are true:

```text
[ ] Every P0 item in §31 is checked with a durable evidence link
[ ] Every required §0–§30 item maps to §31 evidence or an explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE decision
[ ] No required area is MISSING, INCORRECT, PARTIAL, or IMPLEMENTED-UNVERIFIED
[ ] Clean reproducible regression fails hard and passes all variants
[ ] ARM/Thumb encoding, functional, exception, bus-cycle, endian, and debug coverage closed
[ ] Independent differential tests, formal properties, compiler tests, and long soaks pass
[ ] All selected r4p3 errata policies are documented and tested
[ ] Raw ARM7TDMI-S and MiSTer wrapper protocol checkers pass with randomized stalls/errors
[ ] Quartus synthesis, fit, timing, CDC/RDC, and post-synthesis checks pass without open waivers
[ ] A real MiSTer build and on-board PocketStation reference run pass
[ ] Save-state restore is deterministic in the PocketStation integration
[ ] Generic second-SoC integration builds and runs
[ ] README/AGENTS/docs exactly match the audited state and link the release evidence
[ ] License/provenance review is complete
[ ] Two reviewers, including one not responsible for the RTL, approve the traceability matrix
[ ] Release tag, source hash, spec hashes, toolchain, artifacts, and reports are frozen
```

P1/P2 work may be deferred only if it is outside both required profiles and appears in
the signed limitations/support matrix. There are no silent waivers. A post-sign-off bug
creates an erratum and a versioned maintenance task; it does not rewrite the historical
v1.0 evidence.
